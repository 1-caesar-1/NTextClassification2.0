Your Closet Needs This Neutral, Ribbed Sweater For Winter
There’s no outfit I love more during the fall and winter than a neutral paired with another neutral. In this case, I’m talking about a beige sweater paired with white jeans to hone that winter white look while looking insanely chic!
This mock neck dolman sleeve sweater from Express is what sweater weather was made for. The yarn is soft and cozy making it so incredibly plush! I also love the ribbed detailing on this sweater. While this piece looks pretty straightforward at first glance, the ribbing, mock neck, and dolman sleeve make it a unique standout. I opted for the beige color, but they also have a true nude, a rose, and a darker, coffee brown!
A neutral-colored sweater such as this paired with a great pair of bright, white jeans is such an easy, sophisticated outfit to throw together. Express’s High Waisted Supersoft Skinny Jeans were the perfect choice, and the front-hem detailing is something you don’t see a lot. They’re brushed on the inside to essentially feel like you’re wearing sweatpants; that’s how comfortable these jeans are! Tie the look together with some nude pumps, a nude handbag, and a high ponytail, and you are truly a vision and a force to be reckoned with.
I love, love this look and it will be on repeat this season.
