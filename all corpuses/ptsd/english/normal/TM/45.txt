Fighting Baby- Weight?
Exercise at home

With a new baby, finding the time to exercise can be difficult. Lack of sleep and breastfeeding can leave you feeling drained of energy, but remember that not only does exercise help your body recover from pregnancy and birth, thereג€™s also some research to show that it can help treat and prevent postnatal depression. From pilates to yoga and running in the park to yummy mummy clubs, there is a whole range of exercise out there that is just for you. 
Getting back in shape is not something you can rush. It has taken nine months for you to gain your pregnancy weight, so it may take a similar length of time to lose it. Your body has done an amazing job of bringing your baby into the world, so give it a chance to recover. Itג€™s also important to remember that if youג€™ve had a caesarean you should give yourself six weeks to heal before you even think about any exercise.
If youג€™ve had a normal delivery there are some exercises you can do straight away - the ones you'll have benefited from doing all through your pregnancy ג€“ the pelvic floor! 2-3 weeks later, itג€™s OK to do some simple abdominal crunches, providing you have been checked out by a doctor. Your abdominal muscles have been stretched during pregnancy and may have split down the middle so itג€™s important to be examined before exercising. 

After six weeks, there are more exercises you can try at home: 

ג€¢ On your hands and knees, breathe in and as you breathe out, tighten your pelvic floor muscles and pull your belly button in and up. Lift your left arm straight out in front of you and hold it there for 10 seconds. Repeat up to 10 times and then repeat again with the right arm

ג€¢ In the same position, lift your left leg out straight behind you. Hold this position for 10 seconds without holding your breath or allowing your pelvic floor or tummy muscles to relax. Repeat up to 10 times and then repeat with the right leg

ג€¢ Stay on your hands and knees and lift your right arm out in front of you and your left leg out behind you at the same time. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Repeat up to 10 times. Then do the whole thing again with opposite arms and legs

ג€¢ Lie on your back and bend your knees. Tighten your pelvic floor and then lift your bottom into the air as high as is comfortable. Hold this position for around 5 seconds while breathing normally. Lower and repeat 10 times

ג€¢ Still on your back, bend your right knee and keeping your left leg straight, lift it slightly off the floor. Try not to allow your left knee to wobble and keep your hips level. Hold for 5 seconds. Lower your bottom to the floor and repeat 10 times. Then repeat with the other leg. 

ג€¢ Lie on your right side with your knees bent towards your chest. Tighten your pelvic floor and lower tummy muscles. Keeping your heels together, lift your left knee up towards the ceiling. Hold for 5 seconds and then lower. Repeat 10 times, then move to other side. 

ג€¢ Do some gentle sit-ups by lifting your head and shoulders off the floor. Hold for 3 seconds and lower.

Out and about

If you want to lose weight as well as tone you will need to do some cardiovascular exercise such as brisk walking or swimming. If youג€™re lacking motivation, why not try a buggy class in the park? Itג€™s a great way to meet other mums and companies such as Buggy Fit and Pushy Mother hold classes all over the country at a park near you. 

You can also do a buggy work-out on your own or with friends with the Pushy Mothers Buggy Workout Album ג€“ just download it from iTunes. With an hour of motivating music plus expert exercise advice for postnatal mums, itג€™s like have your own Pushy Instructor on your iPod!

Powerpramming run fantastic classes across South West London and also have a great post natal exercise DVD. For the more hardcore (although they do have beginnerג€™s classes) British Military Fitness run outdoor exercise classes across the UK if you can leave your baby, and buggy, at home. 

Nice and warm, indoors

If you donג€™t fancy the park, there are many other classes around that are specifically designed for postnatal women. Yoga is not only great to prepare you before the birth but is also good exercise for new mums. Many yoga centres offer mother and baby classes where you can do yoga while your baby lies on a mat next to you, (hopefully) gurgling happily. Then itג€™s babyג€™s turn, where yoga and music are used to encourage your babyג€™s development and flexibility.
