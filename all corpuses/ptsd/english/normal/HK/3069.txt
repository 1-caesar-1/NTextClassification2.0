How do you protect your data?
The Disturbing statistics on Disaster Recovery:
Only 35% of SMBs have any Disaster Recovery plans in place (Gartner)
The rest will have a survival rate of just 10%
1 in 5 businesses will suffer a major disaster (fire eg. arson, flood etc) every year
Of these more than ¾ will never re-open or fail within 3 years
Of these a half will never return to business
Those that have had a fire and don’t return to business in 10 days will fail
ioSafe manufacture a unique and patented range of fireproof and waterproof server, storage and disaster recovery solutions.
