My First Blog......
I have started my Professional Practice in Dance (Specialisation) M.A towards the end of this week. Starting off with my first group Skype session on Saturday. I wasn't too sure what to expect,However it was refreshingly enlightening!  My initial thoughts leading up to the first group session was that starting the course seemed quite overwhelming. The amount of information you are required to process seems huge and i have never blogged before in my life. Having the online resources at my fingertips has given me a lot of reassurance to research and clue up on blanks i needed filling. I am sure there will be many more blanks as i progress on this course and after the first Skype group meeting i felt reassured.It was great to  discover that there was a sense of a 'community' aspect attached to this course, In that you are not completely on your own as a distanced learner. Hopefully we can all talk and help in any potential grey areas we come across. It was really useful hearing module 2 and 3 students talking about their experiences as they are further along the process of the course.
I am a professional Actor (dancer and singer ) who has been practising for nearly 2 decades and alongside my performing work i have also taught from what i have experienced during this time. It has been a long while since I've been in a classroom with the student cap on instead of the teacher hat. I am a firm believer in my performing profession you never stop growing and learning. I believe you must try to better your self and learn in many ways, similar to a chameleon  in adapting as the industry does and to the ever growing  requirements of its demanding, Thriving challenges. After so long i am looking forward to dipping my toe in the water and embarking on the first steps of a new study, especially during the current pandemic which has completely at present decimated my industry.
