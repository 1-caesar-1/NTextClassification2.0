DEC. 20th, 2010 4-HR SPECIAL STARTS 10pm TONIGHT
1984- 88
NOTE: Early Start Time 10pm- 2am tonight!
Videos were almost as important as the songs they were advertising. It was the time of Band Aid, USA for Africa and Live Aid. Rap finally cracked the Top 10. Dance music made a strong comeback, but in new forms. Paul Simon took us to Africa with his 'Graceland' project and Prince gave us 'Purple Rain'.
Bruce Springsteen had us dancing in the dark, Sade was a smooth operator and Cameo gave us the word up.
Hear great retro classics from Grace Jones, Guns 'N Roses, Bon Jovi, Crowded House, Dire Straits, The Bangles, The Pet Shop Boys and The Cure.
