As I sit at my computer at 2:37 AM, I have loads on my mind. The last 5 or so months have been such a mess and don't even come close to a roller coaster of emotions. For it to be a roller coaster, there has to be Ups, but so far this year only has shown me downs. 2020 has been nothing but a mess, I've found myself struggling for the last little while. We've seen multiple celebrities pass, We've learned about the importance of protesting, I've lost some of the most significant people in my life, along with myself, along with a slue of other things. 
I think when I'm alone I tend to put myself in a really bad spot, almost like I put myself in a position to fail. It's almost like internally I want to fail. I struggle with self destruction pretty badly. I ask questions I don't want to know the answers to. I overthink. I get scared. I think of the worst thing possible. I've probably been doing this since I was 15. I'm 25. I try to keep myself bust and not think of those things, and I continue to think of some of the hardest parts of my life, and then get upset when I end up being sad. 
If I've learned anything from this year, It's that memories are just that. Memories.
