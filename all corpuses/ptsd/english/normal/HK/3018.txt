Flightblogger v2.0 is live!
Good morning!
I am very pleased to announce that Flightblogger has begun its move to flightglobal.com. The move will take some time, so please bear with me as the transition will take time. It was important to get the new blog up and running in time for Dubai.
You'll also find my first story on the 747 program over there. Please feel free to start leaving comments over at the new blog.
The new blog can be found here:
