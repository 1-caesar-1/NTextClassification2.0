A rockin' stitch in time....
In reference to the "stitch in time"...Holy side stitches Batman!  I seem to get them in the diaphragm area quite often.  I'm trying to focus on breathing and what not but still seem to get them.  Is there something else I should be doing for these bad mamma-jamma's?

In reference to the "rockin'" in the title, just made a new play list that is making me as giddy as a school girl.  I've been thinking I need to switch it around a little and change the style to keep my running fresh.  Drum roll please!  


Today I had three miles on the books.  Woke up to lots of rain, instantly wasn't feeling it.  I had about 4.5 hours of sleep from night shift and was looking for all the excuses in the world to not run.  I ended up sitting in my running clothes, sipping on my coffee, telling myself I didn't have time to run because the ladies would be home any second.  

My ma called and said she could pick up kid #1.  Score!  I dropped off kid #2 at dance practice and busted out a nice three miler.  For the run that almost wasn't, I ran all three miles in the 10's.  Huh?  Let me say that again for posterity's sake....I RAN ALL THREE MILES IN THE 10's!!!  Who is this billy bad @$$?!?  Me, that's who!

I don't know if you know this but, I'm kind of a big deal.




After I ran, I promptly fell on the floor at my gram's and the dog tried to revive me in all my schweaty glory.



I know I sound pretty silly being so jazzed and excited about 10+ min miles but ya know, I worked pretty darn hard to get to this point and by gosh by golly I'm proud of myself.  I can't wait to spank my half marathon time in June!

All right, enough fun, off to work some night shift action
