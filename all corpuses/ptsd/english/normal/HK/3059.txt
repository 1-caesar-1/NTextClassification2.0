Long Time no Blogging
It has been a while. Little W is not so little any more so we will have to call him Young W. And as for Little Miss, she's growing so fast she will be as tall as the Missus soon - Young Miss she is now. Teenage Miss is starting her GCSE courses and as for the Missus - she passed her NQT assessment and is now into her second year of teaching. It's a new academic year and among them they are now at 4 different schools. Maybe I should go back to school so we can can have a full set.
And it's not as if we haven't been doing anything new. So... Time to start blogging again... Watch out for some catch up posts over the next few weeks as I get back into the swing of it. Oh, and I've just found a few drafts that never got completed... time to finish them off.
