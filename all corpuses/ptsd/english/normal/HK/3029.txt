Justin Bieber & His Wife Spotted With Chance The Rapper In Chicago
Justin Bieber seems to be everywhere these days. Last week, the Pop singer was spotted hanging out with Kanye West in the State of Wyoming and yesterday, he and his wife (Hailey) were seen having lunch with Chance The Rapper in Chicago. Right now, no one knows if they later hit up the studio but it would be nice to see a new collaboration from the two following up their 2017 hit I'm The One.
