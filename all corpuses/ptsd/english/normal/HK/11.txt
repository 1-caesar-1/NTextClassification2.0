It is funny the things that get you in touch with yourself.
Sometimes it is a bit of music. Sometimes it is a song.
Sometimes it comes about serendipitously when you least expect.
Those touches which  cause sweetness and love to burst forth are the ones most memorable and worth living for. Healing tears flow then.
We can be such a catalyst, and when we are, it is a bit of magic that happens to remind us of our goodness and of God's love of us in spite of all our sins and faults.
It is a wondrous thing when we discover ourselves as we had forgotten we are, for it most often also touches others too, and a springtime bursts forth within us.
