UK PM blackmail of kids - more stupid rules
Pondering thought - The UK needs a new Guy Fawkes, to be done with this lot once and for all. London, time for you to start rioting against this madness.
Boris, fuck off and die you sick cunt with your terrorism of the children. Telling kids not to kill grannie ? You truly are sick, twisted and perverse monster. Never again will I vote in this country, truly I am done with politicians.
Boris, may you forever be haunted by your words and these evil pseudo science acts you're doing. God willing, may all this bullshit you do backfire and finish you.
