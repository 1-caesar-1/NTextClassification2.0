Which is Best? Short Course or MA?
Do you need a degree?
One question we often get asked here at Escape Studios is this: Should I take the Short Course in 3D Animation, or do the Masters' Degree? - Which is Best?
The answer, of course, is that it depends on what you want to do. If you want to be trained to be a 3D animator, and find work in the industry, you don't really need any letters after your name.
But if you have an ambition to teach animation, especially in higher education, then you should do the MA. In addition, MA students have the opportunity to participate in group projects, such as the award-winning short film "Flame". Watch the video below to find out more.
Short Course -v- MA
Both our Short Course in 3D Animation, our Masters' Degree in animation will teach you the art and craft of animation, and the practical skills needed to find work in the industry. However, the MA includes a certain amount of academic content and, in addition, because of the longer course structure, there is more opportunity for students to participate in group projects, helping to contribute to some of our award-winning student films.
Ultimately, which course you choose is up to you, and we're here to help you decide what suits your own personal path.
