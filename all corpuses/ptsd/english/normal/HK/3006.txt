The Early Days of MTV
Last night we watched "I Want My MTV," Tyler Measom and Patrick Waldrop's new documentary about the conception and birth of Music Television, and it sure sure took me back. I kind of thought I knew everything there was to know about the topic but was pleasantly surprised by what was revealed, including lots of graphics and ephemera from before the network even launched.
As I’ve said before, I’m sure every generation thinks this way about its own -- but I wouldn’t trade my MTV youth for bobby socks, Instawhores or anything in between. 
Catch it if you can. It's available on demand via A&E and includes Mark Goodman's excruciating interview with David Bowie where the music legend asks why MTV doesn't show more black artists, a 40-year-old moment that doesn't sound much different from what we're still fighting for today.
