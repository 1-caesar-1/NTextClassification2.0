My heart is brought to a standstill in solitude and silence.
It has been stopped mid-beat by the pain of love,
and my weariness knows no name.
So many crosses weigh me down,
I cannot move,
and I weep for the burden without surcease.
In order to give me breath,
He loves me,
and the rigor of my paralysis is washed away,
and I am wasted by His consoling touch.
This is not a consolation in much pain,
but the joy and love understanding at last
what was the cause which like the fragrance
of honeysuckle on a warm day, as a breeze passes by.
So perfect and sweet that it soothes the soul's worst pain.
Full of affirmation,
it comforts my abandoned sorrow,
for it seemed He went away.
In the tiredness is also pain,
but the pain consoles
and the soul forgets to be.
