Well the black dog has returned once again & it's got it's teeth well & truly locked into me, cannot shake this horrendous feeling of loosing control unable to access any help, mind won't touch, me RBL waste of time, Combat stress forget it so anyone out there fancy meeting up to pull up a sand bag & have a beer ot two, I'm in need of a break.
