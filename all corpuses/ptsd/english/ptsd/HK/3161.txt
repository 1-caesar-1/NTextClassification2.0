Back on chlorpromazine once again 25mg t.i.d, at one time I would have looked on that as being a set back, but, now it's a blip. I've run into a brick wall and rather than look for a way round it, I've been running head first in to it. A couple of weeks back my psychologist decided it was time to push my anxiety and stress levels to a high level, with my new found confidence, I though piece of piss I can do that no problems, sadly I tried to do my usual and run before I could walk. Trying to do to many things at the one time, left me in a total panic.
Normally my wife Linda would step in and tell me to slow down, however, she was asked by the psychologist to help push my limits and rather than let me back down she kept pushing, nae harm to her, she thought she was doing the right thing. She is now back to her old self and it's a case of taking each day as it comes. I think with the light at the end of the tunnel now being so close, it's a question of going all out to get there, unfortunately I'm just fooling myself that getting to the light will come much quicker if I run rather than being patient and walk towards to it.
One day I'll get there, may not be this year or the next but, I'll get there.
