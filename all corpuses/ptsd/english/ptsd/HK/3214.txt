Unloaded on therapist today...
So I’m in week 2 of a new therapist and she’s trying to nail down an “event” that triggers my PTSD. So; I don’t know about everyone else, but I’m pretty sure in a 22 year career spanning 4 presidents and a partridge in a pear tree: there is more than one event.
This led me to informing her that I understand her need to put my issues in a checkbox that can be treated with such and such therapy. However to think that every person who needs help with post traumatic stress has to have a singular event is fucking wrong. I have layers upon layers of response built from literally dozens of examples of scary shit. Wanting me to funnel that into one event that is the “most” significant is all dependent on the day. Did I go to the store? How many fucktards irritated me today? Is it raining? Oh wait, yeah sorry. Let me sift through some of that in the moment then we can work on it in two weeks; meanwhile I would have packed that one away for later.
I guess the purpose of this rant is to say that if you do have a particular event and the therapy methodology works: I’m jealous. Just make sure to not get target fixation and remember that you are a sum of your experiences; not just one.
