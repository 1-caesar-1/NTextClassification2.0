Back in the workforce!
Been a very productive year for me. Once I finally admitted I couldn’t handle my ptsd, and got help. The quality of my life has only increased. Not everyday is sunshine but I am managing so much better. Took the whole last year and focused just on me and my mental health. This week I took the plunge and got a job at a machine shop as a entry level machinist. The anxiety was huge walking through the doors for my interview and again on the first day. Day one almost didn’t get out the driveway. In my head about how I was gonna do. Am I gonna retain the information. How am I gonna be around other people in a massive shop with all sorts of loud ass noises. What if I wake up and there is no way I can work bc of the nightmare won’t leave my mind. To set myself up for success I was very open and honest about where I was as a person and mentally. My concerns and my ambitions. Was so scared I wasn’t gonna get hired bc of this. But I knew if I wasn’t honest and they weren’t accenting then this wouldn’t be the right fit for me. Got the call the next day that I had the job. The CEO sat down with me my first day and we chatted. I’ve never felt like I mattered so much at a place of work in my life. That my issues weren’t gonna hold me down. I’ve kept my ptsd a secret for so long. Lying to myself and others. I’ve convinced myself no one would be empathetic or understand at all. That I would just be a liability. Man was I wrong. So today is day three for me and I’m looking forward to going to work. No anxiety holding me down. I dunno. This is a feel good post for me. Even bragging a bit. This is huge for me and I wanted to share the story. Maybe it will help anyone else out here that thought they were worthless bc of their disability. Good luck everyone and be safe.
