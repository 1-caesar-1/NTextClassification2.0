Has anyone ever felt this type of loneliness?
Hi there! Prior army.. 1 combat deployment, 1 deployment as a contractor. After a broken back I filed disability. Im currently rated at 100%, PTSD, depression, and anxiety have been a big factor in that rating. I consider my self proactive about treatment (therapy, acupuncture).
I struggle everyday with mental health symptoms (hyper alert, generally very tense and nervous etc .. working hard on this). I’m 27 years old, using my GI Bill, work out everyday, ride my motorcycle.
I haven’t been laid in 8 months. I feel so ashamed of my symptoms and I try so hard to control them but it never works... iv lost all confidence with social situations, mostly with women. Every time I get a girls number, these feelings of self doubt stop me from texting, it makes me nervous having people get close to me. I do not go out to bars or restaurants normally, when I do I’m stuck at the bar staring at my drink, crippled with anxiety and fear, from the ptsd symptoms.
This is a subject i just started thinking about, so I’m coming up with better ways to describe how I’m feeling, so bare with me.
Has anyone felt this way ?
