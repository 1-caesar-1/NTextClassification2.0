Got my first appointment with Combat Stress later this morning, looking forward to having the chance to sit and talk to someone without feeling as if I'm being judged because of the feelings I've bottled up.
Perhaps over time I'll have a better understanding as to when and where my Dysthymia actually started and whether the 2 are in fact linked.
