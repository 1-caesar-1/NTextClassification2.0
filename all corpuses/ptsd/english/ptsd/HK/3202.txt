Yesterday was my second session of counselling and it was even more intense than the first, because the last session began to open windows on incidents that enabled me to look at them in different ways. This session allowed me to look more closely at those differing views and explore them more widely.
In effect it has me thinking that do I remember things as accurately as I thought, or has time removed certain details as to how I remember. Going over one incident in particular has made me realise that there was more to it and was not as clear cut as I have remembered it.
