Getting worse when starting exposure therapy?
I went to Iraq in 2005 and it took me almost killing my self to get help. I spent 5 years depressed and in denial (that cost me my first marriage), 2 years in a drunken stuper (not wanting to continue drinking cost me a girlfriend, went to therapy till I lost my insurance and was better for a while, spent another 6 years muddling through life somewhat numb but not bad, then a year and a half ago everything came flooding back and I was sitting under a bridge with a gun in my hand. Not sure what stopped me 100% but I knew I needed to get help.
Started seeing a counselor who had very limited experience with ptsd in veterans but helped a bit. I got on Celexa swapped to Lexapro and things were good ish. I finally got to a place I thought I could handle therapy and found someone who specializes in trauma and ptsd.
Been going for 2 months now, using exposure therapy as the main process, and while some things are better I'm starting to slide into a dark hole again. I have weekly appointments and will be talking about all of this with my therapist but that is Thursday and I got problems now.
Is sliding back to depression normal when going through exposure therapy? Getting worse before getting better?
I am starting to get to the point I don't enjoy painting miniatures any more. That was one thing that I could do to relax, zen out, and actually enjoy. That worries me a bit.
Really just need some encouragement hope that this is a normal part of processing an extremely abnormal experience.
