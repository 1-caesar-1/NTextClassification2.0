Animals
I was cleaning out a closet at my house when a mouse popped out. I went to kind of kick it away and accidentally squished it. Like, little dude just exploded. and now I feel like I'm having a panic attack and there is ringing in my ears. I'm already on some ptsd meds through the VA but this is new and my meds don't seem to bed working for this. Any advice? Has anyone experienced anything similar?
