It took me 30 years to find out I had PTSD. I’d known there was something wrong, and spent countless hours and dollars trying to ‘fix’ myself. When the diagnosis came, it was an amazing relief… at last I could understand why my actions and reactions for so long had been so irrational. But that was only the first step. Jumping through hoops to have the condition officially recognised and treated was almost as bad as the original traumas – and this time around I lacked the resources of a bullet-proof 20 year old. My GP said ‘I was in Vietnam at the same time with the Medical Corps. Best holiday I ever had. Who put you up to this scam?” The symptoms worsened. I couldn’t work or concentrate, became a virtual hermit for about five years, withdrawing further emotionally from my family, often in depression or anger, with painful reactions to noise. Decades of sleep deprivation and use of only the lowest moods. Treatment since has helped; the flashbacks are gone, I can now shop and walk in crowded areas, and loud noises rarely send me into a quivering mess. I still hit the wall, but the good times are lasting longer.
