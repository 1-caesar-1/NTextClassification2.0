Just diagnosed
Hey everybody this is my first post but I just wanted to reach out to the community. A little background: 27M US Navy Arabic Linguist with work in IQ and SY. I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, insomnia, panic attacks, and self hatred that stemmed from some experiences I had. I outprocessed from the Navy this past April and my mental state quickly deteriorated after that.
I guess I always knew in the back of my mind it was something like PTSD, we just never talked about it. Maybe it was a taboo topic but I can't remember ever having a conversation with a fellow service member where my alcohol abuse wasn't a topic of funny discussion. It came to a head and during my VA disability process I had a meeting with a therapist that lasted roughly two hours and it fucking sucked. I hate the things I have done and what I've become and it definitely manifested itself into what I am now. Needless to say the review came back as I suspected: PTSD.
I am curious as to what people who struggle with this do to cope. Weed? Drugs? Service Animals? Idk really anything about this and I am just trying to be happy again. I hope everyone is doing well and look forward to speaking with y'all.
