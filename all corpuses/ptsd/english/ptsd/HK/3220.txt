My service dog may be dying right now.
It's Thanksgiving day, and I'm not at the table, I'm at an emergency veterinary clinic waiting to find out if my PTSD service dog is going to be alive come tomorrow morning. He suddenly became very ill and tbh I'm freaking out. I don't know what I'd do without my furry buddy, and things don't look good. Fuck.
