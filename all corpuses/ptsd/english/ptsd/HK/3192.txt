Yep, every day. I don't know how to live in this uncivilized world and want to cut myself off from everyone and everything. All the VA does is prescribe more medication, I have severe difficulty with showing up to work and completing 40 hrs/week. I'm in constant physical pain and having to go to constant appointments is a part of have difficulty showing up to work. I've never struggled like this before. Being diagnosed with PTSD/MDDR does not help whatsoever.
