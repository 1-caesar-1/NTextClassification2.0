Introducing myself here today! Thanks for the add. I am a US Army Combat Veteran. I came upon Heilung while listening to Wardruna. I absolutely love the rhythm and tone of Heilungs music because it helps me get lost in the beats. I served in Iraq in 2004 and brought home severe combat related PTSD. Getting lost in the music is so effective when I become overwhelmed with anxiety. 
Thanks again for the add.
