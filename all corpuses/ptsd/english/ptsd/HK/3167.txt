7yrs ago on this day I was diagnosed with PTSD, it has been one long roller coaster ride, full of ups and downs more downs than ups, divorced, ostracised my children. I live like a hermit, my life consists of work home work. Its difficult to get of this ride you think you have got off, but suddenly out of the blue there it is! a reminder, and then one memory leads to another and the ride starts all over again... I'm tired of being tired but you learn to pick yourself up and fight another day.
 take care everybody.
