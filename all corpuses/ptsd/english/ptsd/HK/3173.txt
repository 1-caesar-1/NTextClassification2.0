So frustrated with these damned fireworks
I'm in the middle of such a huge fucking struggle right now. Last night, for the third night in a row, my neighbors were shooting off those fucking mortar fireworks two doors down in the middle of my street. Because I'm fucking terrified every time I hear them, of course my 6 year old thinks she has to be afraid of them too. I'm struggling to take care of my kids (2 and 6) because my wife is still active and TDY. I'd had enough at 2130 last night and went out to tell these guys to give it a break. My 6 year old in my arms, shivering and crying, I yelled to the group of them. One came over and we talked and he agreed to take the fireworks somewhere else. We live in a subdivision and he offered to take them up to the poolhouse. Right as we were parting ways, a cop came up. I went back to my house and a few minutes later the doorbell rings and the cop tells me "It's not illegal to shoot off fireworks, but it is illegal to be shouting in the street." The fireworks started again right as this guy tells me I could be arrested for disturbing the peace if I confront them again. So I got to sit upstairs with my 6 year old until past 2300 until she finally went to sleep when these guys finally let up, which means I couldn't sleep until 0200, and my 2 year old, who is sick, woke up at 0315 and hasn't been back to sleep. I just can't handle this shit. I hate this fucking holiday. I'm snapping at my kids, I've already broken down into tears more than once this morning, and I'm just so fucking manic I don't know what to do. My wife comes back Tuesday and I just want to keep it together until then. I'm tired of calling the veterans crisis line, and I'm pretty sure they're sick of hearing from me too.
