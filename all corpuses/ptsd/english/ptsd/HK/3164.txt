Been away for a while, sorry folks, just when you get on top of life the demons reappear again and remind you how vulnerable you are, you just cannot afford to let your guard. What a life we live, but hey at least we have a life so onwards and upwards as they say. To all of you suffers BE STRONG, I know that it is difficult but keep the lines of communication OPEN.
take care all
