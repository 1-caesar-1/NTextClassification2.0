PTSD and the VA
So I've been diagnosed with PTSD for some things I did in Iraq. I didn't know what was wrong untill I started having panic attacks and blacked out at work. I thought it was a heart attack but apparently not. The VA rated me at 50% which is too low I think as I haven't been able to work because things have gotten so bad.
I went to the VA inpatient program for treatment twice now. It seems to help while I am hospitalized but not so much after I go back home. I have done everything they have recommended, pills, counseling, everything they requested. The last statement of the case they sent me says all that is available to base my request for increase is self reported statements. I know the doctors and psychiatrists at the VA inpatient hospital took notes as well as the psychiatrist and counselors I have been seeing for the past 6 years.
Are they just hoping I will kill myself before they have to increase my disability. Honestly some days that seems like it would be easier than dealing with the VA anymore.
I went to see an outside psychologist to get an actual written medical opinion since the VA doctors say they don't provide paperwork for disability purposes. The psychiatrist cost $600 and when I went for my results a week or so later she wanted to have me committed. I am not doing great but I am not bad enough to be hospitalized again yet. I have talked to my psychiatrist when things are so bad that I am running out of options which is how I ended up in the inpatient program the last two times.
Does this ever get better? I'm starting to think it will never end. I don't know how much I have left in me.
