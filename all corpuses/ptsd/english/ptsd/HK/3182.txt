Issue in the civilian world
Sorry couldn't think of a good title. So I've been noticing a lot lately that ever since I got out at the beginning of July and had to deal with civies on a daily basis that some of my ptsd symptoms are manifesting themselves more and more. A little background, I was I n from 2004-2019 and saw three tours to irag as a combat infantryman. Saw my fair amount of shit as anyone to was over in the early part tod the war can attest to. Definitely can e back with a major personality change. For example, I get agitated easily and it's apparently super obvious as my coworkers ask me why I look so angry. I cant sleep for shit, lots of insomnia and erratic sleep schedules. I can't hold a relationship and have been unable to get back into dating as my dating pool is almost exclusively civilians and they think I'm gonna murder them or something. Anywho, question I have is was the army the only thing keeping me together as its such a regimented lifestyle or does the civilian world really just bring out the worst in me. I definitely feel it's something that needs to be addressed before depression rears it's ugly head again and I become one of the 22. Thanks for the input.
