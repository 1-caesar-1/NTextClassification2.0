Been a while.
Over the last year i have gone out of my way to get good with my mental health, physical health, eating, outlook on life etc, basically doing what i can to be better for me.
Last night was like hell all over again, i woke up after 2 hours of sleep and could not shake the feeling that i was about to be Mortared, that my house was about to be attacked, i was waiting for a rocket, a burst of full auto or shouting by Them. i don't know how to explain the raw fear and terror i felt, that i haven't felt in a long time. i sat on the floor all night, sitting watching the exits, listening to every creak, every noise of the wind, wondering if this was it. it was,is horrible, as the sun is coming up here now, im starting to stand down. but hell i have been awake, waiting all night despite knowing it isn't coming. i feel disappointed, i thought i was finally over these nights. its been 8 months or so since i last had one.
