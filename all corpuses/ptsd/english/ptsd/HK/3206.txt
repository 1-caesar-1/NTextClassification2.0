I'm creating this group to share information, maybe get together and go fishing or play pool, or maybe just talk about a problem your having. I know how hard it is living with PTSD, I live with it daily. It can be very challenging but with some help or someone to talk to it can really help. I own an online business and would love to share my information and possibly help someone do the same. Any Veteran is welcome I just wanted to focus on PTSD because I know it. If any of my family or friends see this, please share.
