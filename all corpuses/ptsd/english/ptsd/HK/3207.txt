I'M STILL STICKING TO IT AND IT FEELS GOOD
It's been a couple of days since I last blogged but I've kept at the better food and diet choices as well as the exercise. I actually got in ride number four of the week tonight and tipped the scales at an increasingly svelt 299.6 pounds.  It took me less than two weeks to get back down under 300!
In spite of all of this, I'm still really struggling on the weekends. I went to the gym this morning, got to see my daughter at swim lessons for the first time, and went to lunch with my parents. But I still felt 'off'. I struggled to think of anything else to do other than just come straight home afterwards and 'hide' in the house. I think things are going better but it's frustrating that I can't seem to snap out of the overall funk that has been lingering around for way too long.
I still think there's something to be said for being lonely. It's hard to enjoy going out when there's no one around to share it with. I know, I know - how am I lonely with this much family around that cares about me? And that's just the thing. Not having a partner in crime is starting to wear at me. At least I'm now receptive to the idea...I wasn't before.
More to follow soon!
