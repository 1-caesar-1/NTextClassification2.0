Unknown to most people I left the mob in 90 because after my moment of bravery in adversity in 89 I could no longer face the prospect of dealing with multiple casualties. Nor did I like explaining about my gong as it brought on flash backs.
I felt then because my condition was not recognised that if I opened up and admitted my problem the only support I would have got was a trip to the Physc and a boot out of the mob and then having to face revealing at every job interview why I left. 
So I left of my own volition and got another stressful job. Lots of ups and big downs before a trip to Occ Health and a diagnosis of PTSD. Lots of counselling etc. But thankfully I was in a job that couldn't boot me out with ill health bearing in mind this was before the Disabilty Act. So I struggled through my episodes for 20 years and retired at 51. 
I still have my moments where things go disastrous but I always seem to bounce back thankfully.
Keeping fit is very helpful for mental health imho. So onwards and upwards lol
