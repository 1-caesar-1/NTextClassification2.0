On this date 9yrs a go, I was diagnosed with PTSD, and what a journey it has been, I will be eternally grateful to Audley Court a residential treatment centre of Combat stress, for the help and guidance they have given me. A special mention must go to Duncan my councillor who for the past 7yrs has been visiting me every month he has cajoled me. made me cry and laugh and without his help and wisdom I would not be where I am now, to all of you who suffer from this disorder hang in there be strong their are people who do care, I have also been lucky to have the support of a wonderful family. And to my friends THANK YOU ALL.
