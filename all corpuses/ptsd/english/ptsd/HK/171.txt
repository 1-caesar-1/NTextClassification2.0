I'm completely fucking broken
I'm on three separate medications, only today I was officially diagnosed with PTSD.
I've had to pry my battles from their seats because fat and skin melts to polyester. Fires so hot their rifles and sidearms melt into the airframe. At this point, being in Rocket City is an afterthought.
I guess Huntsville, AL holds that name now. But, it didn't hold that name when I was on Romeo Ramp on Bagram.
I was on nightshift for the majority of the time. We'd laugh and cajole when the WAVES alarm went off a quarter mile away. How shitty is it that these people sent rockets/mortars/artillery at us. At least it was someone I didn't know or relate to. And those were the times they didn't hit within 20 meters.
And that haunts me to this day. Every time we took IDF, I knew somebody HAD to be hit. They're inaccurate, but they're not NOT aiming either.
My proudest day was when we sent outgoing rockets. I don't know if we killed anyone, but we definitely let them know how we felt.
4 KIA. Afghanistan, 17-18
