I lost my innocence during four and a half months in a Turkish jail, powerless and terrified because no-one knew I was there. I saw brutality beyond what anybody could imagine. I had been so brutalised and displaced mentally by the horrors of the experience that when I was released I was a puppet. In the beginning I wasn’t aware that I had post traumatic stress disorder. When I returned to Australia my mental state manifested in anxiety and nightmares and night terrors and fear. I started to avoid people, I lost my job, I lost my home, I lost the beautiful young woman that I’d married and the two young children that we had… It cost me a lot. And I still didn’t know about PTSD. Now, it is a recognised mental illness, but in the society we live in it is seen as a weakness, or you are seen as a coward. They talk of combat fatigue and battle stress, but I saw it clearly that PTSD is horror fatigue. I went through the Prozac era, with doctors pumping me with sedatives, and I descended into another hell – prescription drugs – almost as bad as had happened to me in Turkey. I’m improving now, and Picking Up The Peaces is a very important part of my life, and a natural supplement to the hard work I put in to get off benzos.
