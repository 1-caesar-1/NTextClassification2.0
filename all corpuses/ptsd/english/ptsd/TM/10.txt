I try not to surrender my thoughts to you but I cant help it. I try to piece together everything you did to me but it's like I blocked it out. I understand that's what my body is doing to protect me but I want to know. I remember I was wearing light blue Jean's. The brand was vanilla star. Three buttons up the front. They were flare Jean's cause that was in style. I was wearing a blue and black off the shoulder sweater. I curled my hair because I knew I would see you. Not sure why I cared. We were in your room. On your bed. I had never been there before. You asked if we could have sex I said no I was on my period. You got on top of me and were kissing my neck. You got upset because instead of responding I was texting my friend trevor. I remember you laughing because my hair was a mess. I remember you texting me days later that you had to stop your dog from eating my tampon.  You didnt like that I laughed. I guess I want to remember the middle.
