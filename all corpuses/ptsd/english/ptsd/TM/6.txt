My birthday was yesterday and I can honestly say it wasn’t a good one. I had those uncomfortable feelings and depression creep up. I’m 25 and I feel like I have been stuck in square one my whole life and everything around me sounds like a broken record. 
This is also around the time I admitted to family what happened to me.so I feel my birthdays after that day have been tainted. But while my actual birthdate may not have been good I can still celebrate and do things to help lift the clouds.
Though, it doesn’t help that a couple days before my ptsd was triggered. A man kept pressuring me for pictures and wanted to send pics of himself. He also kept talking in a very inappropriate manner to someone you’ve never met. It was through an online dating app. What really sealed it for me was the constant pressure he put on me as well as the total disregard for my protests and feelings. It reminded me of my attacker and how he pressured me. It really brought me back to that night. But instead of letting it consume me I contacted a friend of mine. He helped me stay in the present and reminded me that past circumstances do not define me and to not let someone like that make me feel like less of a person. 
As always I have my music. Along with a new gym membership complete with personal trainer so I can finally loose weight. Starting to do something about my weight has helped make me feel better and has helped with my nasty mood swings. My mind feels like it’s own hell at times and having things to focus on in the external world I’ve come to realize is  crucial. 
Even channeling my thoughts and feelings into poems and writings has been helpful As well as challenging myself at work. Overall everything just feels the same. A constant battle with the demons inside and there’s seems to be more everyday. But so far I’ve kept my head relatively above water this time around and that’s something to be proud of I think.
