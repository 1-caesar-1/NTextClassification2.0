Hello
Im almost 23 woo hoo (dont like the age i am now big trigger for me but will put that in another post somewhere) Im married and have been for nearly 2 years, and we recently found out we are expecting our first child, Im 6 weeks gone. Im a survivor of ab*se and r*pe, will post my story soon.
I have reported my ab*sers and am currently awaiting to hear back from the CPS. I suffer with some mental health problems because of what Ive been through but am in the early stages of therapy (DBT) and once my baby is born and I am stronger I will proceed with counselling or psychotherapy.
Ok thats a little about me, its great to be here.
