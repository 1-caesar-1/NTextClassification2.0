Such
He was just a bad writer, not knowing what to do
We had a chat, a talk about writing too
And thats where I left him, I could not beware
For it reminded me of the past, that awful stuck lair
And I waited for a while, uncomfortably long
I thought he challenged me with another, feeling so strong
I got a bad impression, was he just like those guys
Would this happen again, I said, ever so wise
And I was told people would help, but I gave up there
For if you grew up with it, they don't really care
Would you wait and wonder, just what will happen next
Will they force you again, force you to have sex
The debate such continues, alone in your head
That old mode of thinking, sometimes you would rather be dead
For its what my dad did, many years ago
Reliving itself in this chatting, ever so slow
I get trapped, I run, I get trapped again, cannot escape
I remember back when I scream, I get upset, I repeat the words; that hate
A little girl crying out just waiting to be heard
Unsure what to do, feeling unheard
For the past replays itself, in your head
Just as you learnt to tie your shoelaces
Or eat crust on your bread
You learn how to relate, with your mum and dad
And there it repeats again and again making you sad
Not sure what to do, not sure what is said
I suppose you just have to trust that thought in your head
And here I am wishing again to forget the past
So AGAIN, I wont have to face this, as it sits and lasts
I can't give you the answers, I have not figured it yet
For I was treated with misery with utter regret
But once I break free, I will understand it then
I know I will get over it, with the help of such friends.
