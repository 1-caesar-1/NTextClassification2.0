Hi guys..... I'm new here... joined a little while ago but have been lurking to get the courage to post...
I'm 26, from the UK, like to play the guitar and write music. I was abused as a child, teenager and adult. Spent a long time burying it all and pretending it didnt happen, or that it was normal and everyone had stuff like that happen to them. Wasnt until about 2 years ago that I started to realise nothing about it was normal. I'd think about it occasionaly before then but not properly. Even convinced myself I had made it all up in my head a few times. 
Finally trying to think about it but its tough. More than that. It's impossible sometimes. Ive spent so long trying to put this wall up and make people think I'm this reallyt tough cool guy but inside I just feel like a bag of emotions. I'm scared to open that up but I know I can't keep everything inside for much longer. Honestly so much stuff has happened recently that i can't help but think its because of it. I keep doing different things but ending up in the same place which I know won't make any sense but... yeah. 
Anyway I started going to therapy recently... and my therapist keeps asking questions about did anything happen in my childhood. I like she knows something's up but I make sure to get her away fromt he topic. every time i think I can speak about it I wimp out. Like I'm literally just about to say it and it's like the words are literally just about to come out and then I shove them back down. I just cannot do it. I've never told anyone anything that's ever happened. I don't know how to.
God ive rambled sorry.
