If rape is a form of theft, what did it steal?
Rape stole the close relationships I had. The shame/ need to keep my secret led me to push people away so they wouldn't see. It stole my sense of safety and trust in people. It stole what should have been fun happy memories with friends, replacing them with memories of feeling triggered, upset and unsafe. Rape stole my concentration and hence my school and collage grades. It took my sense of self worth, then compounded this with the feelings that I'd let people down/people had less respect for me, e.g. my Mum for "not focusing on my exams", My best friend because I asked about the morning after pill again. It stole the person that I thought I was, the person I thought I would be. Rape stole my trust in myself.
