Always There
When you took everything
an unwanted gift remained
the darkness and the pain
it's always there
When boiling water
rains down my body
can't take away the fact
it's always there
When elusive laughter
spreads across my face
im quickly brought back
it's always there
When darkness falls
and sleep evades
I feel your touch
it's always there
When silver flashes
and the red river flows
only numbs briefly
it's always there
When i forget for a second
a trigger breaks free
it comes back to me
it's always there
When healing progresses
Im two steps back
Your gift weighs heavy
it's always there
When life gets hectic
there's little time to think
yet still somehow
it's always there
When I'm called a survivor
Confusions left behind
How is this surviving?
it's always there
No matter how hard
i try to move on
it's always there...
...what's the point?
