"Friends"
I have read some comments and one said to ask your friends to write nice things about you to cheer you up. That is such a good idea, however, I have "friends". People who claim we are friends and don't show any signs of being friends. I am always there for them when they need it but when I need them they are no where in sight. Some people get upset when I call them out, but they know that they aren't being the best person they can be. I would donate a kidney to them because thats the kind of person I am. And I know they wouldn't even send a text to me. How hard is it to send a text that says "Hi"? I understand they are busy but it takes two seconds out of your day and you aren't even willing to do that for me. As soon as I ask them if they are busy they say "Oh yeah sorry I didn't text you I was super busy." and then they are out on instagram partying and hanging out with other people. I feel like I am unworthy of their friendship and they aren't even willing to send me a shred of support when I need it the most. I have told a total of like eight people about all the trauma and most of them are supportive. Others don't even reply to my texts and that is a shot to the heart. I just wish that I could get the support I give others
