Its hard
I fasted for a total of 66hours drank soo much water and have lost 1.6lbs :) I know I could've lost more but I weighed after I ate instead of before, mainly because my scales are messed up and keep messing with me saying 160lbs 165lbs until it finally showed me 170lbs like 10 times yesterday...
Aghh its hard my boyfriend is like why aren't you eating? 
I said I ate at work and hes obviously shocked Im handling 5mins without stuffing my face he says hes worried...? 
Like how am I supposed to do this if I cant even last 3days without someone forcing me to eat....
And I still haven't started my course and im still fat and im so annoyed I said I wouldn't allow myself and look at me now fat face chest belly bums & legs I hate it all .
I did buy my B6 & B12 though they are the only thing keeping me awake I want to sleep but instead im gonna do pilates and jumping jacks and crunches until 10pm so I can shower and hide my exercise evidence before the boyfriend gets home @ 11pm.
I was reading blogs I followed before and so much has changed most of you are gone some have sadly passed...but the ones that are still here and still going you are my motivation everyday and I will get down to my GW. No matter what.
