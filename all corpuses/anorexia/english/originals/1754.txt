Dear my body;
I hate you. I really do.
Thighs, please lose all unecessary baggage.
Butt, please unload all of the junk from your trunk.
Stomach, please oh please discard all of that fat that is so obviously there.
Body, please become as perfect as the bodies of the women that walk down the Victoria's Secret runways,
Or become as perfect as those bodies I see on thinspiration sites.
Body, please became one that would be seen on a thinspiration site.
That is all I have to say to you.
Become perfect.
Yours sincerely,
Anafly
