Ottolenghi - lamb
Had surprise guests for dinner last night and just a few hours to get ourselves together. decided to use Ottolenghi's recipe for lamb marinaded in honey and herbs. It was sublime - despite not having the time to marinade it overnight. One kilo of meat was sufficient to fill 4 adults to popping; you know the food is good when even the most cautious eater says they'll share seconds with someone else :)
the marinade is surprising in a few respects - firstly that so many ingredients can blitz down to so little; but also that that "little" is plenty to marinade a kilo of lamb in. It is bunches and bunches of mint, coriander, parsley, and then a good few glugs of red wine vinegar and honey. Whew! it was delish and will definitely appear on our menu again.
