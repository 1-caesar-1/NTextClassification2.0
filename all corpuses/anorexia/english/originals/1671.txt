I have suffered from an eating disorder and I am currently recovered although I think it never really goes away; it will always linger around and will strike when stress arises. I notice in times of stress that I start paying more attention to my diet because it is still one of the things i do have control over. Even in times when there isnt stress in my life,I am still not able to eat a whole mars bar (too scary), and when I am angry with myself I still punish myself with not eating. Sometimes I wonder whether I need the control not because the things in my life are out of my control, but because I am out of control internally and I am not feeling balanced emotionally. It is fascinating to see how many people are actually suffering from disordered eating. I see more and more people in my environment with disordered eating behaviours and quilt feelings about eating. I think anorexia is in some cases a reaction to the other extreme, obesity. Both caused by either a lack of control in life or a lonely empty feeling that is caused by a society of having to achieve and be perfect. I am trying to make something positive out of my experience by giving a workshop to teenage girls. I have done the `Body think` training of the Butterfly Foundation in order to educate teenagers about positive body image. I believe a positive body image will prevent emotional imbalances from becoming dangerous eating disorders.
