Tips:
1) It takes 12 hours before your body starts feeding on its own fat. So don’t eat before 7am and after 6pm … your giving yourself a 13 hour fast.
2) If your craving something, grab a glass of water and count to 50. If that doesn’t work, brush your teeth.
3) Feeling hungry… chew some sugar free gum
4) Drink tea, it suppress your appetite (honestly, I couldn’t survive without it)
5) Plain celery is your best friend because you end up burning calories as you chew.
6) Use small plates, it tricks your body into thinking its going to get more.
7) Drink water. Especially before, during and after each meal, it makes your fuller without adding extra calories.
8) If you must go out somewhere, take only the bare minimum amount of money so you cant buy food.
9) Always leave something on your plate, it will stop you compulsively finishing of your meal.
10) When you have a strong craving, go as far away from the kitchen. Lock yourself in your room for an hour and the craving will be gone.
