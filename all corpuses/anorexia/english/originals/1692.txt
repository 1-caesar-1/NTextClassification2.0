Body Checks photo pile
It is bloody hot in England today: 36*
I'm at home, keeping an eye on an elderly relative and my pet rabbit who is pretty fluffy.
So for all of 5 minutes, I was in the garden doing some body check photos (wearing summer clothes).
My face has been deliberately left out, to keep some anonymity.
*There are more photos but internet on my fone has gone to crap, so I'll save just these for now
BMI today is 17.7.
