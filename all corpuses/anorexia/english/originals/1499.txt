Like a fish out of water – but like a grizzly bear in it
I love swimming. I love the feeling of being light weight, lifted off my feet and floating.  I find the repeated rythms relaxing and drift off in my own mind.  Apart from the fact I can’t put my head under the water and can really only do the breast stroke, there really aren’t any negatives.  I even enjoy it so much that I don’t notice if anyone is staring at my beach whale body.

But, does swimming have an effect on weightloss? I’ve read so many conflicting opinions online recently – some saying, yes of course, why wouldn’t you lose weight as you burn calories, through to the more ridiculous ‘you’re in cold water and your body holds onto fat to keep you warm.’
What do you all think?
Personally I would say, go for it. In addition to strength training and other cardio exercises, swimming can help tone the body and increase lung strength etc. So there’s nothing to lose!
