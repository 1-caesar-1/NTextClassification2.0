Norma has lost 20 pounds by juice fasting

Let’s celebrate 20 pounds down since 7/31 with Norma.  She looks amazing.

She says, “I currently lost a total of 20lbs so far, my starting weight was 173 on 7/31 when I started the “FAT SICK AND NEARLY DEAD” juice fast by joe cross and I have 8lbs left to go to get to my goal weight of 145lbs. I walk for an 1 hour a day or more except weekends and I do some exercises at home such as squats, light weights, jumping jacks and push ups. I have been a vegetarian for about 5 years now and by doing this juice fast I will transition myself to a vegan/ raw food lifestyle.” I believe in the power of raw food too, Norma. Congrats!
