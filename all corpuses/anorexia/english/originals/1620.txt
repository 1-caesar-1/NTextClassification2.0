Stuffs in my life
OMFG THE DUMBASS WEEKEND DIETICIAN AT THE HOSPITAL MADE ME EAT 3300 FUCKING CALORIES TODAY. FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I want to die so bad. I know I'm still "technically" underweight (bmi 16.7) but all the weight I've gained is in fat so I'm not skinny anymore. Why is it that the more weight I gain the more she makes me eat!!!!
Also, random thought, I've never seen a male dietician before. Do they even exist? 
I'm 99.99% percent sure I'm gonna relapse when I discharge. I'm not ready to recover, I haven't reached my UGW yet. They didn't let me reach it before I got hospitalized. Oh but I missed food SO MUCH. a gross part of me is glad they're making me eat because it tastes soooooooooooooooo good. If I don't reach my UGW on my next relapse before they hospitalize me I think I'm gonna kill myself.
FML. 
I'll keep adding entries. Not that anybody cares or is even reading this.
