Olympics inspiration
Okay, my husband is really into the Olympics - this is fine as I kind of like it too, and I like suddenly becoming an expert on things like diving or gymnastics - I loved sports at primary school and played badminton and netball for the school but my teenage years were a bit marred by teacher strikes and so  there were no opportunities for extra-curricular things like sports fixtures against other schools. What a shame such things were considered as extras that teachers and pupils had to do outside of regular school time!!
Anyway, I wish I had kept up sports but I hid behind asthma and I have paid for it ever since!  If only I had been active for longer in my youth then I wouldn't now need to lose so much weight (5 stone by the way).  I was going to a personal trainer until recently when I was made redundant and could no longer afford him, but I am making a commitment today that not having his support doesn't mean I can't work out!  I will blog again tomorrow after my home work out.
Oh,and the hygge part?  Well I think for now it's about how I treat myself rather than how many candles I light.
