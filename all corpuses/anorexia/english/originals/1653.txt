I went back to my therapist and I actually managed to tell him I've wanted to die, every day for the last few months. He finally seems to be taking me a bit more seriously.
He seemed understanding, I'm going back weekly for a while. He even booked me in for appointments after my 18th birthday which I don't think he's allowed to do since it's a child and adolescent clinic, but he said he's scared to let me disappear at least until after my exams.
For the evening before my appointment and a lot of the day I was in an unexpected good mood, I actually saw some hope and a purpose in life.
Then out of nowhere in the evening I lost my mind. I'm trying not to cut anymore since it's summer soon, so I went mental punching every inch of my body but it didn't hurt enough. I settled for trying to break my arm by beating it with various hard objects. I didn't break it, but today I have the most disgusting bruise it hurts to brush up against anything. I really don't know what triggered it. I've never been that crazy before.
I have history coursework due in tomorrow (well technically it was due months ago, my teacher's extended my deadline to literally hours before the exams board will want it sent off). I doubt I'll get it down. All I want to do right now is cry and sleep forever. But I can't let her down again. She's been too nice about it.
I can't turn up empty handed.
I'm such a worthless idiotic bitch.
