Today was mentally horrible but I restricted to 70 calories!
So today I had a whole bunch of issues with 2 of the guys I'm talking to. I made it very clear that I didn't want a relationship but for whatever reason they both decided to have a meltdown about that today and I'm pretty sure I basically lost them both. Because of this happening I stayed in my room most of the day and slept after working out for about an hour! So the only thing I had today was tea(0) and coffee(35) for breakfast and then a plain rice cake(35) for dinner! I also lost 1.4 pounds so I'm completely happy I don't even care about anything else that happened!!!
