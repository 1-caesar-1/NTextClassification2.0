Hey darlings. And by darlings I mean Bella I think you're the only one who reads this.
I'm having a bit of a crisis but I'm back from up North now.
I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I haven't been taking the new antidepressants he gave me because a massive side effect was weight gain. And I've gone so downhill, and I feel like shit and I wrote a list of all the things I need to say to him, everything I feel and the biggest things that scare me but I don't know if I'm brave enough to give it to him. I'm too shy, I just let my doctor talk and lie and pretend I take my meds when I don't and I want help so bad but I'm so scared.
Sorry it a self obsessed rant. I hope you're okay.
