Sorry seems to be the main word in my vocabulary...
I'm back.
I previously sort of recovered by myself unintentionally and I waited for ana to take me back.
I've relapsed and now back with my lovely companion.
I've missed her and you guys.
There's so much to catch up on!
I hope you guys don't mind having me back.
It's going to take me some time to get back into the swing of things on here, I hope I don't dissapoint.

I know this may sound bitter and twisted but I'm so glad that I'm back!!!!
Lots and lots and lots and lots of undying love,
Anafly
