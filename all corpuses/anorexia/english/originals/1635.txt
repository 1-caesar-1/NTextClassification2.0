Emotions
Sometimes I sit on my bed and trace my collar bones and hip bones and remember the time before my life was overcome with the desire to be thin. I Try and remember what it was like to sit down and not have to think about how my thighs squish together. I try to remember what it was like to love the way my body looked without having to be a lower number on the scale each morning. I try to remember what it was like to look down and not worry about if I’ll be able to balance a ruler on my hip bones today or not. I try and remember what it was like not to get up at 5 every morning and run until I can’t breath. I try to remember what it was like when I didn’t do 300 crunches a day in a desperate attempt to get rid of the food I had eaten that day.
And I can’t do it.
Sometimes I think I can, but all I can remember about the past was how I used to be 125 pounds and I have only been able to drop to 108.
It’s all I can think about. I am constantly checking and rechecking to make sure I can still fit my hands around my calfs, my thighs, my wrists, my neck, to make sure I can still feel my collar bones, my hip bones, my spine, my ribs.
It’s all I have now.
And I don’t remember how to be happy without being thinner.
