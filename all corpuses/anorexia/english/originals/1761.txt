Could I be any worse of a human?
Well I'm approaching my 10 year mark of having eating disorders and it's hitting me pretty hard tonight. I'm not sure why it is but, I guess it's because I went out to dinner with my ex that I dated almost 3 years ago at the height of my ed and we got mexican food and 4 hours later when I finally got home I purged? The question mark is because I know that after 4 hours there is absolutely no point in purging so, I don't know why I did? I'm seeing someone I used to really not like (He used to be my exs best friend until they had a huge fight and now hate each other) and he makes me happy and everything has felt like a movie between us its been so good. So, why am I so sad tonight? Why am I back on here after so long? Why do I still want my ed to get worse again? Most importantly why do I think I love him after such a short period of time of only liking him as a person? I leave for grad school in a month and I'm sad, excited, happy, and scared all at the same time. I've looked at pushing my move date back because I don't want to leave him yet. I'm not ready for it to be over yet. I don't want him to move on so quick. Yet, with all of that being said, I'm still just hoping my ed will take over now that I'll be living on my own again and I just want to get back to my LW. How could anyone love someone like me right now? They couldn't. But, deep down I'm begging him to feel the same. I'm begging that he will want to try to keep seeing only me even after I leave. Maybe it's just an infatuation but, right now he's almost all I can think about and it's completely consuming me. These are the parts of me that I hate the most.
