Monday, the beginning of a fresh week and the start of the challenge! Your all probably wondering what the challenge actually is, so I will get to the point. Myself and fellow pro-ana chat members are competing to be the first one to lose 5lbs (approx. 2kg) whilst also following the 10 day challenge —>
I’m also going to pay for a weeks gym access… maybe more if I can afford it, but I’ll cross that bridge later. Anyway, feel free to participate in the challenge. I will be posting my points from the 10 day challenge everyday so if you want you can also post yours bellow as a comment, I would love to see that <3.
Stay strong
