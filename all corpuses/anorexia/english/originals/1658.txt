Okay, so this isn't my first time with an ED. I am a "recovered" anorexic with purging tendencies, who is now at a healthy weight and discharged from inpatient and outpatient services. I am 19, female and from the UK, other details will follow when contacted. I'll give tips/help and am looking for someone to vent to/encourage me. Let's be friends!
