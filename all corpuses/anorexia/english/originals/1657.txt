HI~ I'M NEW  
Just a little about myself~
My name is Kat , I'm 19, and I'm Anorexic
I think i've had it for abouuuuttt 5 years now?
I never really classified it as Anorexia until recently when my doctor confronted me about it.
I used to be really skinny in middle school, under weight, but when i got into Highschool and got into an accident i started Homeschooling and gained all the weight.
The biggest I've been was 144
And i am now 124
My goal weight is 100-105 maybe 95
I'm really looking for friends who know what I'm going through cause none of my friends understand me
It'd be nice to seem normal
ya know~
