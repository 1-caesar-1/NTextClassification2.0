Digestive Bugs; a Hidden Cause of Weight Gain in Women
Did you know, digestive bugs are a hidden link to unexplained weight gain in women?  The great news is, there is herbal and nutritional support that WILL make a difference.
Although I have previously discussed digestive flora before from it's influence on serotonin and cravings, new findings directly link it to poor glycaemic control and unexplained weight gain – and after 16 years of practice, it really makes so much sense!
Recent research has shown that digestive health, plays a significant role in both obesity and diabetes, primarily due to a deficiency in a protein called toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a regulator of digestive flora in our gastro intestinal tract. This allows harmful bacteria to multiply and taking probiotics can actually make it worse!
In short, a TLR5 deficiency changes your metabolism. It means you can exercise and count calories or live on lettuce leaves and not lose weight.
The reason being, the food you eat is absorbed at a faster caloric rate than it is meant to. Think of the example of you are out to coffee with a friend, you both have a skiny latte – your absorbency is the equivalent to having two! This is because a deficiency in TLR5 causes:
Increased carbohydrate storage
Increased caloric absorption
Increased insulin production
Increased leptin resistance
Increased fatty acid absorbency
This means, if you have unhealthy digestive flora and a 'gut bug', although you eat healthy, you may extract more calories from your foods, even if they are 'healthy' and gain more weight.
This is why you might eat less than your friends but still gain weight!
