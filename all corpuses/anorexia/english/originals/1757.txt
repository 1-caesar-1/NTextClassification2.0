So obviously the US and Australia differ greatly in food and I thought a thread where Aussies could share low cal foods would be good. I'll start!
All of these can be found at Woolworth's! I bulk buy the fish from Costco. Also Curly Wurly's I get from convenient stores because Woolies didn't have them -___-
Here is my list:
Bird's Eye Crumbed Hoki Fish Fillet
2 fillets = 293 calories
Uncle Ben's Express Single Server Rice (Fried rice/Mexican rice)
1 bag = 195 calories
Curly Wurly
1 bar = 119 calories
Hansells Creamy Rice (Vanilla)
1 pot = 117 calories
Jumpy's Chicken Flavoured snack things
1 bag = 92 calories
Woolworth's Organic Macro Apple Puree 
1 pot = 54 calories (!!!!!)
Aeroplane Jelly Lite (assorted flavours, in my opinion peach iced tea is the best)
250ml = 7 calories 
Woolworth's brand Garlic Bread
1 slice = 88 calories
Health Attack Cripsy Fruits freeze dried fruits (apple is the best)
1 bag = 39 calories
Kirk's Sugar Free Lemonade, Pub Squash and Creaming Soda
1 can = 2.2 calories
Foster's Clark Custard Cups
1 cup = 132 calories
Bird's Eye Potato Waffles
1 waffle = 105 calories
Dorito's Salsa - Mild
40g =  13 calories
Calciyum Strawverry Yogurt 
1 pouch = 100 calories
Diet Rite Apple Raspberry Cordial 
1L diluted = approx 30 calories (depends how strong you like your cordial)
SUBWAY

Use this to calculate the total in your sub!
I get a 6 inch white bread with ham, lettuc, olives and cheddar, it comes to 288.70 calories!
Lastly for people from Adelaide, Australia:
Cucina Cibo pasta meals available at Woolworths - the largest portion of delicious lasagna is 490 calories.
The wide ribbon pasta with beef ragu is only 376 calories and it a massive serve of pasta!
Other Aussies feel free to add your finds!
