body checks photo pile
it is bloody hot in england today: 36*
i'm at home, keeping an eye on an elderly relative and my pet rabbit who is pretty fluffy.
so for all of 5 minutes, i was in the garden doing some body check photos (wearing summer clothes).
my face has been deliberately left out, to keep some anonymity.
*there are more photos but internet on my fone has gone to crap, so i'll save just these for now
bmi today is 17.7.
