i have suffered from an eating disorder and i am currently recovered although i think it never really goes away; it will always linger around and will strike when stress arises. i notice in times of stress that i start paying more attention to my diet because it is still one of the things i do have control over. even in times when there isnt stress in my life,i am still not able to eat a whole mars bar (too scary), and when i am angry with myself i still punish myself with not eating. sometimes i wonder whether i need the control not because the things in my life are out of my control, but because i am out of control internally and i am not feeling balanced emotionally. it is fascinating to see how many people are actually suffering from disordered eating. i see more and more people in my environment with disordered eating behaviours and quilt feelings about eating. i think anorexia is in some cases a reaction to the other extreme, obesity. both caused by either a lack of control in life or a lonely empty feeling that is caused by a society of having to achieve and be perfect. i am trying to make something positive out of my experience by giving a workshop to teenage girls. i have done the `body think` training of the butterfly foundation in order to educate teenagers about positive body image. i believe a positive body image will prevent emotional imbalances from becoming dangerous eating disorders.
