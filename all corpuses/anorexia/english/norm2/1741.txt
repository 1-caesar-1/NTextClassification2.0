the ice is getting thinner
tips i've picked up on my rounds on pro-ana sites that i think have potential/tried and tested:
- keep a stash of prothinspo images. google image search 'go to' celebs you know wouldn't ever fail you for when you're feeling weak, eg kate bosworth, kate moss, lindsay lohan, erin wasson.
- drink black tea, black coffee or water whenever you feel hungry! the caffeine in tea and coffee will perk you up, the water will clean out your body and tea is filled with antioxidants. they also fill you up :-)
- wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it when you want to eat. you will train yourself not to think about eating.
- eat in front of the mirror (naked or not!).
- fidget fidget fidget!
- if you feel like you need to binge, go for a walk and make yourself busy for 20 minutes. if you're on your own, do starjumps in front of the mirror!
- chew very slowly. break the food down as much as possible! you will feel fuller quicker.
- eat seaweed or take kelp pills to boost your metabolism.
- sleep as much as possible. not only does that mean you skip meals, it is also proven that those that sleep more tend to eat less than those who do not.
