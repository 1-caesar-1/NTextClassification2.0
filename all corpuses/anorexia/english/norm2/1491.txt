olympics inspiration
okay, my husband is really into the olympics - this is fine as i kind of like it too, and i like suddenly becoming an expert on things like diving or gymnastics - i loved sports at primary school and played badminton and netball for the school but my teenage years were a bit marred by teacher strikes and so  there were no opportunities for extra-curricular things like sports fixtures against other schools. what a shame such things were considered as extras that teachers and pupils had to do outside of regular school time!!
anyway, i wish i had kept up sports but i hid behind asthma and i have paid for it ever since!  if only i had been active for longer in my youth then i wouldn't now need to lose so much weight (5 stone by the way).  i was going to a personal trainer until recently when i was made redundant and could no longer afford him, but i am making a commitment today that not having his support doesn't mean i can't work out!  i will blog again tomorrow after my home work out.
oh,and the hygge part?  well i think for now it's about how i treat myself rather than how many candles i light.
