wieght-loss tips
hi again,
with summer here in full it is a great time to get out and enjoy the outdoors. however, for some it can be a time of embarrassment. who want to wear shorts or summer tops when you are embarrassed about your size.
well this is a great time to start looking at your diet and get back to eating wholefoods again.
with so many fresh fruit and vegetables available at this time of year, why eat ready made or packaged food.
i love to bbq my vegetables and a good tip is use melon chunks as well as vegetables on the skewer, as this give a great variation. do not get bored with eating the same foods experiment and enjoy the different flavours of the food. use scant amounts of sauces or dips, enjoy the real flavour of whole foods. if you do not bbq then steaming vegetables will bring out their flavours even more.
to make lemon-aid or even ice tea start from scratch. lemon-aid take the lemons and cut in chunks squeeze out the juice but put the lemon skins in a pot with a small amount of water and heat. heating the water will infuse the flavour more. then add all this to the rest of the lemon and add water to make the right amount. if you need to sweeten slightly add honey rather than sugar.
ice tea make a strong pot of tea, let cool, pour into jug and add mint, orange slices, strawberries or any other fruit you wish. top up with water, taste if need more flavouring add some lemon or orange juice to it. much more refreshing than a soda.
i mentioned before that a great program i found www.mnb-weightlossprogram.com helped me to understand the different types of foods and what combinations and portions sizes worked best to combat my weight and i am sure it will help you too.
since getting back to wholefoods i have to say that i feel better and have more energy and i am not having such a hard time controlling my weight.
i hope this is encouraging for you.
until next time
