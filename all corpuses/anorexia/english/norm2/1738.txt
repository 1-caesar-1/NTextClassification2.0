i am so over starving myself
... but it's the only way i know how to lose weight quickly. us ed types know that losing a pound a week is just not enough. 
my weight is gross, my eating habits are uncontrolled. i've been telling myself that i don't want to starve myself and that i can do this the 'normal' way by correcting my diet and exercising. but i just end up eating too much during the day and then i fail at night, because i'm like - well this extra 1000 calories isn't going to make a difference, so give me that jar of peanut butter. 
today, i'm gonna aim for 800 calories. 
thus far, i've had a small tortilla (122), a tiny avocado (100), free from cheese (50?) and a nectarine (63) and that's a total of 335 cals. i'm going to have a cup of coffee now with soy milk and then that's it till dinner. for dinner, i think i'll have the same tortilla wrap. 
this has been the most fabulously lazy weekend, i've done nothing. and my flat is kinda clean, so i don't even have to worry too much about sorting that out either. i may do some laundry now. 
a bit later, i've got yoga and i'm doing a double class - an hour and a half of normal and then an hour of restorative, which is almost better than sex. 
i'm meant to be video chatting with chris later, but i just don't feel mentally like i'm in a place where i want to speak to him. so i might skip that.
