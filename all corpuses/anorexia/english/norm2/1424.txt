off to europe
this may be a very short and/or incoherent post, considering i am leaving for hungary tomorrow and could hardly sleep 5 hours last night. nevertheless i find myself here in good faith to my blog. i am very nervous. only once was i in a foreign-speaking country, and even then were there many who spoke english to me. here, i am to understand, very few people speak the language. what's worse is that i will be helping run an english camp. just me and my partner in front of a class who don't speak a word of english. literally. needless to say, i am fairly terrified. 
on top of this dilemna, i have not finished packing yet. i have a piano lesson that i did not practice for. and i have foolishly scheduled a day of frivolity with some friends, when i hardly have enough time to sleep. i do not know how i shall get it all done, and if i do, in what condition i shall be. i have already packed the essentials for my journey; yarn, jane austen's "mansfield park", and some more yarn. it will be a pleasant trip so long as i hold onto those possessions.
ok it's really funny how my whole style of writing has changed since i listened to "northanger abbey" by jane austen yesterday. it wasn't until i reread the beginning of this post that i noticed how british and odd my diction became. very amusing.
i have no crafts to display, although i have been crafting fervently. have just finished the items for my swap on craftster and will be shipping tomorrow. which is also when i will be leaving. i also ordered a set of denise knitting needles. i can't wait. 
oh blog, hopefully i will be able to give you more attention when i return.
much <3,
