i'm back...
hey guys,
thank you for all your kind words!
thought i might put a little something as i'm feeling a bit more optimistic!
yesterday i lost 2lbs, because i had half a roast chicken sandwich and a handful of grapes, and did a 4 mile run- soooo proud of myself!
so today me and the bf are having a summer salad out in the garden cause it is just such dreamy weather, so hopefully that i'll help keep the lbs off!
i now know how much support i have on here, and hopefully i can regain my blogging routine.
strawberry, i eat oranges instead cause i despise grapefruit! faaaaar to sour for my liking! and tuna is a god in disguise! ;) and yeah i'm going to try and have a lot more steamed broccoli and cauliflower if i get hunger pangs. but recently i'm just not feeling hungry! today i had a petit filous and the other half of the sandwich from yesterday, so i'm doing well. i just keep thinking, don't! because you will hate yourself tomorrow.
thank you so much for everything :)
here's some summer thinpso for you all to enjoy :)
