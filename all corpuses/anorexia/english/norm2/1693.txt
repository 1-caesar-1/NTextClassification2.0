144
144lbs that is, when i stepped on the scales test morning. bmi 18.4. so the number is not as bad as i thought but i feel big anyway. story of my adult life! ??
because the weight number sounds high regardless, i feel like i have to specify bmi to clarify i'm not medically overweight.
there was a question on mpa asking "who are you in competition with?"
myself.
each goal weight needs to be beaten by reaching it, then getting lower.
ultimately its a race that cannot be won, but i'm running it anyway. that might be where disorder overtakes logic?
