10 day diet
june 7, 2018caty
so i found this diet, currently i am on day 6, and it’s been going really well! i have lost 2 lbs so i am down to 107. i also workout a ton which def helped. this one is great because it helps me not to binge. y’all should try it!! here’s the layout:
✦ day one: fast
✦ day two: 200 cal
✦ day three: 250 cal
✦ day four: 300 cal
✦ day five: 350 cal
✦ day six: 400 cal
✦ day seven: 450 cal
✦ day eight: 500 cal
✦ day nine: mono
✦ day ten: 500 cal
mono means you can only eat one food all day. i think i am going to do soup or cereal. no cal limit on it but just one food. it also gives me motivation because i can eat more the next day. if you know you have really bad cravings for a specific food, save that for your mono day. remember to exercise at least an hour a day. a meal plan really helps. should i do a meal plan post soon?
stay strong and starve on my lovelies!
