healthy start
so.. i'm on the road to a new body started my clean eating plan yesterday (monday) joined up at the gym as well and started packing really healthy lunches and snacks for work. today:
breakfast-oats with rice milk blueberries and a dash of cinnamon 
morning snack- banana and strawberry smoothie made with greek yoghurt.
lunch -rye wrap with chicken baby spinach tomato and cucumber.
afternoon snack -rye crackers with boiled egg and cottage cheese.
dinner- kangaroo steak and steamed broccoli and cauliflower.
it sounds like a lot but there's really not much calories in everything if u think about it, i'm supposed to eat 5-6 small meals a day every 2-3 hours. anyway i'm really enjoying it so far even tho it's only day 2. i should take some pics of myself for before shots! i hate those but hopefully i can make one of those awesome before and after pictures 
other than that beau finally got a job, hence the reason we can afford to go to the gym now even tho i am paying for him, i guess he paid for me last time we went to the other gym so yea... this is great i feel like this will be one of the best summers everrr!! i got such a good deal joining up, didn't pay a start up fee or anything because the manager of the club lives with the girl i work with, she lives in a share house so anyway, still unfair she gets her membership for free tho lol. 
so that's all for now, hope everyone is doing well.
