lies lies lies
it is far too hot and sticky today and i am far too sweaty sitting here in the little study, tap tap tapping away at the keyboard in a room surrounded by books to give you guys a proper post, so this shall be fairly short.
i made a mistake. i let my mum read my copy of unbearable lightness and now she's become suspicious. she wants me to talk to the school counsellor about my best friends all moving to the country but i refuse. i'm not talking to the counsellor about my 'problems' ever again. mum says that if i don't talk about my 'problems' or 'issues' then they can come out in other ways.
she also gave me the 'you need to put on weight' talk. she also said that people have noticed my weight loss.
she asked if i knew how much i weigh,
to which i replied no, i don't weight myself.
she asked if my periods were regular,
to which i said yes, i had it a week ago. i haven't had my period in roughly three months.
she also said that anorexia can sneak up on you,
i just smiled to myself and thought 'i know that and too bad, i'm too far in this now.'
ps. welcome new followers! i can't believe i've cracked the 50 mark!
also, thank you all for your beautiful, beautiful, beautiful comments.
i love you all, my secret little butterflies.
