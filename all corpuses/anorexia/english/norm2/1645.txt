support buddy
hi! i'm just reentering this because i gained a lot of weight pretty quickly after "recovery" and i feel like i could do much better with someone to talk to and support eachother, i know none of my friends would understand. i'm 20 years old, 6 ft, and currently weigh 188lbs, my goal is 150, and my lowest was 140. i can download whatsapp or kik i would just like to have a buddy or even a group so we can help and support eachother.
