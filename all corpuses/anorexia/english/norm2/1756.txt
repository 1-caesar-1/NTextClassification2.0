skinny love
i'm so sorry to brag gorgeous girls but today has been another good day for my eating, i'm thanking a relaxing weekend at home.
breakfast: an avocado roll,
= 149 calories
lunch: 3 raw cauliflower flowerets (isn't floweret an awesome word? i just learnt today that that is what the little cauliflower pieces are called) and a mug of rose and french vanilla tea,
= 10 calories
i haven't had dinner yet but am planning on having 1 cup of cauliflower soup which will equal to 93 calories.
this will bring todays calorie intake to 252. woohoooo :p
i'm not under 49 kilos yet though... i think i'm going to have to keep on going for a little while for that to happen.
now girlies, i need your help. i've realised that a lot of my meals have carbohydrates as i loooove bread *licks lips* and i don't mind the odd pasta. any suggestions on vegetarian meals that don't have a lot of carbohydrates?
good luck with the week, think skinny
love you all,
anafly
