back on track!! :)
right so got my new laptop im not gonna be on my phone anymore so i can do actual posts.
i will post daily-ish lol
 i have a plan to get skinny again im upset that i cant seem to stick to my restricting im like doing good all day.. get home and eat like a starved child.
my motivation has more than gone its vanished, left, deserted to say the least because of uni my priorities are all over the place :(
im going gym monday-wednesday-friday but the boy goes with me (following..literally) and after about an hour and a half he wants to leave..i swear i could live there...
anyway because my restricting to max 1000calories my body keeps flactuating (if thats the word..im tired)
so i have a new plan i literally just saw this on some website so im copying (cat) and going to give it a go
