each day is getting easier and harder
since i had my frozen strawberry yoghurt (30) made last night, i could start my day earlier without waking people with loud kitchen appliances. i got up at 4, and at 4:30 i popped it from the fridge to the freezer, did a short warm-up run, and now i'm waiting for my yoghurt to freeze up a lite more :) so i'll be having breakfast at 5am, running again by 5:30. i want to get 45 minutes done before mum gets up, then another 15-45 depending on how i'm going.
my friend who cancelled on me the other day is popping around at some point this afternoon, but i'm not too sure how long for. i asked her to come around after lunch, so i know i won't need to eat around her. either way, busy morning, relaxing afternoon, <350 calories. i am disgusted by how much i've been eating the past few days, and i need to change it. so, the plan is to run 60-90 minutes this morning, keep on the move, then stop after lunch and relax (in the shed, away from food).
oh, and the soup i made last night? a-maz-ing! so dinner is sorted for the first time in days - no excuses :)
next measurement date: june 5th
next weigh (if measurements are on track): june 14th
after i next weigh, i'm gonna start a 30 day challenge :)
