motivation???... someone.... somewhere????
ok nothing is working, im in desperate need of motivation... so bad it's not even funny! my life sucks right now, b got the sack last week so we're stuck on a single income (mine) my eating sucks, my exercise is lost and i'm not sure i'll find it anytime soon... i feel fat and pathetic! 
blah! i never post cause i'm so hopeless there isn't anything worth saying, if i do it will just be a rant like this post and i'm sure nobody wants to read that.... 
i need a plan, a diet, a fitness program, a lifestyle change... something!!!!
