the light
 i died once. 5 years ago. there was no reason. it just happened. my heart stopped beating. i am only alive today because someone, one man, refused to give up on me. like i had a purpose. i was given a second chance. but why? why me? what amazing things could i do in this broken world? me. out of all the people who die everyday. me. i was chosen. i was given another chance at life. like great things are expected of me. but what? 
they say everything happens for a reason. but that's not true. some things just happen. no reason. it's simply god's will. 
i will always wonder why i was given a second chance. i'm human! we, as humans, question everything. it's in our nature. 
the light. that's a purpose. i headed straight for it. i was excited. all my pain was about to end. a great new beginning was ahead. then, suddenly, a surge of pain hit my chest! the light became brighter. almost blinding! a man lingered above me. he looked tired. concerned. scared. but, yet, oddly determined. who was this man? he was in no way familiar! it took what seemed like hours (but were a mere few seconds) to realise what was going on. i was in an ambulance. the siren was deafening. the lights were blinding. this man suddenly looked relieved! then i realised, he was a paramedic. he said "welcome back! stay with me now!" he had saved my life 3 times from the moment i collapsed. he told me not to panic. that everything will be okay. i trusted him. he seemed trustworthy. there was something rather soothing about his voice. i felt safe. i did as i was told. then everything went black. 
i awoke in the hospital only a mere few minutes later. i felt tired. exhausted even. my chest felt like i had been crushed beneath a fallen building. people were rushing all around me. i had a nurse next to me checking my blood pressure. a friend sat at my other side. he looked so scared. what had happened? 
i asked the nurse. she was lovely. she had a very kind and gentle voice. she told me that i was a fighter. she said i was lucky to be alive. she told me "well done for hanging on"! i had stopped breathing. from there my heart stopped beating. the paramedic got it going again 3 times. 
3 times. 
3 times that man saved my life! i was so grateful, yet oddly confused. why was i saved? why was i given that second chance at life! a fighter? me? i didn't see it. 19 years old. fighting fit. and i died 3 times. mentai! i recovered. went on to train horses. broke many bones - including my back. i actually got crushed by this marvelous beast and still walked away. the nurse was right. i was a fighter. after my near death experience, nothing ever got the better of me again. i realised that anything is possible! we all hold the key to our own destiny. we choose the paths in our lives. sometimes, we get a little lost along the way. sometimes, we need someone to help point is in the right direction. 
1 man helped me choose mine. he showed me anything and anyone can be worth fighting for. he faught for me. a complete stranger. he fought to keep me alive! now 5 years on, i can't help but think, "was it all worth it?" "should he have spent his energy on another?" 
sometimes i find myself wishing he hadn't fought so hard to keep me alive. i feel as though his efforts are being wasted. i will forever be in his debt and utterly grateful that, because of this man, my parents didn't have to bury their daughter. 
everything happens for a reason... so why me? do i think i will ever find the answer i am searching for? no. some things just are. not everything has a reason behind it. we just have to learn to accept what is and live our lives to the best of our abilities... i like to think, one day, i will do amazing things to aid this broken world. one day. just not today...
