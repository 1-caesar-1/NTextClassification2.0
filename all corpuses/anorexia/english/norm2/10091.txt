meanwhile, at the airport...
i used to put pictures of my travels up on the blog.  now, they end up on facebook instead.  instead of a handful, there are hundreds, and it's where i go to look first for my holiday pics.  this past weekend, i headed to canberra for a couple of days.  when i first asked people for recommendations of things to do there, i was told to 1) watch the traffic lights change 2) check out costco and 3) see if the rex hotel is still around and whether they do break in those little flower pots still (bill bryson reference and on a sidenote, if you haven't read his book about oz and live here, it's a must read). i'm glad i've paid attention over the years to the one or two people i know who went to canberra and loved it.  it's definitely a museum nerd and wino's paradise.  there's even some spectacular food and beer, so i'm not sure what there is not to like.  anyway, this is how we felt about canberra.
