help.
i miss the old blogger, not that that matters, but these just don't feel like my posts anymore!
i can gradually feel myself getting fatter day by day, hour my hour. and i'm doing nothing to stop it! i haven't been to the gym in god knows how long, and i just keep making myself believe that sex will burn it off, and weed will keep my metabolism burning at an intense rate, and food and moderation is the key!
when it isn't!
it's the devil!
food is making me fat, and moderation, should be starvation.
and i need to regain control!
i am in such a depressive stage and i wish i could get back to my 90lb self that i was little until 5 years ago. 
skinny,
happy. 
and skinny. 
that was all that mattered back then. 
now i am fat. 
and unhappy.
i need you guys.
i need to get out of my rut.
please help me
i know i can do this.
i just need guidance
