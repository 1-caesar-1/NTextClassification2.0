day#1
i decided im going to starting posting my progress here because it will keep me accountable. today with all my running around i burned 350calories. i fasted for 22hours and at the end ate a small apple-48cal(i didnt finish it all) later i had some lucky charms and animal crackers(which im trying to get out the carbs)-85cal and popcorn-114cal. in all i had 247 calories today. and am back at fasting. i lost 1lbs (108 to 107). if anyone has tips to how i can do better please tell me! i hate being this weight...
thank you so much for reading!
