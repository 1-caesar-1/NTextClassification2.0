peanut butter cup blondies
there was a beautiful breeze blowing through my kitchen window on sunday morning. everyone in my family was taking a nape, leaving the house was quiet, with the exception of the birds chirping outside, the trees blowing in the wind, and the sound of the an occasional card driving by on this dead end road. it felt so much like autumn i think i should've been baking apple pie instead of blondies!
these blondies are very moist, dense, soft but still chewy, with the wonderful taste of peanut butter and chocolate. i've used this blondie recipe before, and i stole the chocolate frosting recipe from my awesome friend "hollie". the difference? this time instead of nuts and chocolate chunks, put chopped reeses peanut butter cups in the batter. no, it's not original at all, but it's extremely tastey!

while baking, prepare frosting.
chocolate frosting:
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
6 tbls. boiling water
1 stick butter

add the cocoa powder and water in a medium bowl and stir into a soft mass. add butter and blend to combine, about 30 seconds. beat in powder sugar and vanilla on low speed until incorperated. beat on medium speed until forsting lightens and is fluffy, about 2 minutes.
let blondies cool the spread with forsting. warning: these won't last long!
