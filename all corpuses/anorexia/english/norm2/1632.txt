doctor’s appointment update
i went to the doctor’s yesterday and wasn’t able to update and tell anyone how it went.
so here it goes.
i got weighed and the lady who was weighing me wouldn’t let me see the number on the scale. which really bothered me. then i had to wait in a small room for twenty minutes while the doctors talked about random stuff. then i had to fill out an idiotic survey, then i had to wait even longer while they went over the answers. then they came back and asked me the same questions in person at least four different times.
and after all of that, there wasn’t even anything wrong with me!
what the actual fuck.
so i got to leave on these conditions: my mom makes a smoothie for me every morning and she packs my lunch. it says nothing about me having to eat the lunch or drink the smoothie. honestly, you’d think that doctors would have enough brain cells to put that on their little sheet. of course, when mom made me the smoothie this morning, i didn’t drink it.
apparently they think that if they talk to me sternly and write things on paper it will cure me. you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped, and i most certainly don’t want to be helped. i am so close to my goal weight, i weighed in at 108.7 pounds this morning. no doctor is going to take the joy of achieving that beautiful number 80 away from me. pardon my french, but fuck them.
