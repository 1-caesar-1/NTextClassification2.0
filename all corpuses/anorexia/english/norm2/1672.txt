my eating disorder has got hold of me and everyday i feel revolting, miserable, and totally confused about my thoughts. i feel that i`m insane- i don`t know which thoughts are my own and which are not.
i feel that nobody can convince me otherwise in my thinking that people don`t like someone as much when they are fatter. i have that notion firmly implanted in my brain, and i feel it`s unerasable. 
i convince myself that it`s too much for me, and then i try to live normally... and it never happens. because i can`t live normally and i am not allowed to.. and my eating disorder tells me that i actaully don`t want to... and so i am trapped forever. it has me, in every possible way. and it doesn`t want me to let it go, and it convinces me that i don`t want to let it go. how do you help that? won`t somebody please help us..
