:)?
hello lovelies.
so today went well i think. i ate:
4 rice cakes = 120
shapers chocolate = 81
vegetable stir fry = 400?
2 x coffee = 10
3 x tea = 30
hot chocolate = 40
= 681.
i'm sure that's wrong somehow because i don't feel hungry. argggg i'm always so scared i've messed up counting my calories. even though i've been doing this so damn long i know how to add for gods sake. wep :(
so the food side of things seems to be going okay? i've been well under 1000 the past 2 days. my goal is to get down to eating 500 a day. by next monday i will, definitely. eat less and less each day.
get smaller and smaller and smaller.
and disappear forever.
goodnight everyone.
rydw i'n caru ti, kiki xx
