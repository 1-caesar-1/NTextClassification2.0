happy holidays!!!

as alex and i get ready to spend hours on the road visiting our michigan and missouri families over the next two weeks, i will be thinking of how grateful and lucky i am to have the support of so many amazing people. you have blessed my life in so many ways without ever knowing it or receiving recognition for it. even if you're someone who just visits my blog regularly and never leaves a comment... thank you. thank you for listening. thank you for caring. thank you for understanding.

to my clients, all of whom i consider dear friends- thank you for inspiring me every day - without you, i would be nothing. thank you for encouraging me and supporting my passion. thank you for opening your heart to me and sharing some of the most amazing moments of your life with me. i'm humbled by your love and compassion time and time again. because of you, i strive to be a better person each day.

to my photographer friends whom i've grown so fond of, thank you for sharing your wisdom, your questions, and your ideas. i owe so much of my progress over the last year to the many things i've learned from you, and will continue to learn every day. i never take for granted how far i've come on the shoulders of other people. i only hope that i can continue to pay it forward for others.

to my friends and family, who have been with me every step of the way, thank you for your patience, for never crushing my spirit, and for allowing me the freedom to explore until i found something i was truly passionate about. my life has taken many twists and turns over the years, and no matter what direction i wanted to take, you were always right there with me enjoying the journey. thank you for continuing to support me in all that i do. because of you, i am successful in everything i put my heart into.

... and last, but certainly not least... thank you god for bringing all of these amazing people and gifts into my life. though there are times i don't feel worthy, i am always grateful and careful not to take these gifts for granted. my life is so blessed!
