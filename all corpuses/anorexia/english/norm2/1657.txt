hi~ i'm new  
just a little about myself~
my name is kat , i'm 19, and i'm anorexic
i think i've had it for abouuuuttt 5 years now?
i never really classified it as anorexia until recently when my doctor confronted me about it.
i used to be really skinny in middle school, under weight, but when i got into highschool and got into an accident i started homeschooling and gained all the weight.
the biggest i've been was 144
and i am now 124
my goal weight is 100-105 maybe 95
i'm really looking for friends who know what i'm going through cause none of my friends understand me
it'd be nice to seem normal
ya know~
