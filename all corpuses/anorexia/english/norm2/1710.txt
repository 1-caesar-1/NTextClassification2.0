today was mentally horrible but i restricted to 70 calories!
so today i had a whole bunch of issues with 2 of the guys i'm talking to. i made it very clear that i didn't want a relationship but for whatever reason they both decided to have a meltdown about that today and i'm pretty sure i basically lost them both. because of this happening i stayed in my room most of the day and slept after working out for about an hour! so the only thing i had today was tea(0) and coffee(35) for breakfast and then a plain rice cake(35) for dinner! i also lost 1.4 pounds so i'm completely happy i don't even care about anything else that happened!!!
