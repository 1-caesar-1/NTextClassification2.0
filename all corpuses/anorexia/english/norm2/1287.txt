holiday time!
i just realized it's been too long since i've posted here.  but i didn't want to pass up the chance to post on 12-12-12, the last symmetrical date we will ever see in our lifetimes!  and it's happening right in the thick of holiday time, with hanukkah underway, christmas very close, and the end of the year within sight as well. 

i absolutely love christmastime.  and though i haven't been as diligent about my exercising as i would like, at least i have not abandoned it altogether.  if i can even go to the gym once a week between now and the end of christmastime (in our house, january 6 is the last day of christmastime), i'll consider it a success.  though i haven't really lost any weight since we got back from ireland in early november, i also haven't gained any - i'll take that, thank you very much.

i know for a lot of people, the time between thanksgiving and new year's day is when they lose their motivation, time, and desire to remember to stay healthy.  it's so easy to do, since even if you don't go crazy with parties and celebrations, there's usually something on your calendar that keeps you running around.  i'm doing better this year than i have for quite a few years, and it's actually making me more thoughtful about eating and exercising.  i grab some steps whenever i can at work, and on days when the weather cooperates, i try to walk around the block at least during lunchtime, or take the slightly longer route walking home.  i haven't made myself give up any goodies, but i try to not eat as much and/or have a smaller meal next time.  i enjoy this time of year too much to become a martyr.

and tomorrow, i have my annual mammogram.  i don't look forward to it, but i know it's necessary, and have been fortunate to have been able to avoid even more drastic measures down the road since my cancer was caught early.  every year, i think my luck is gonna be up again, but so far i've had a good report each time.  hopefully tomorrow will be the same result.

in the meantime, i'll be right here, enjoying myself.  why don't you do the same???
