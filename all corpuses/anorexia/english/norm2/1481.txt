the start!
yes, finally i have started this ridiculous and mind you long overdue aim of finally getting fit. the target is one year from now (to be exact 05/05/2012), i will have shed the three and a half stone, maintained not only the weight but the excercise habits that i plan to develop along the way. one year and no going back. so readers, if you are out there: i need your support and will very very very much be grateful if from now and then you could look in on me and ask me how i'm doing. i will answer and i will be here each and every day writing on my progress and letting you know how it all goes.
one thing i won't be doing is probably sharing the name of the weight loss method because then it would just be free advertisement (and as although i am known at the greenwich gazette for my love all things free whether in giving or receiving i think this one would be too much even by my standards). i know it is a safe method of losing weight. tried and tested. so i will refer to the weight loss plan as "the plan" because ultimately that is what it is. plain and simple. tomorrow a new dawn begins and i look forward to where this journey will take me. i expect you to be there with me each and every step of the way.
thank you all in advance.
