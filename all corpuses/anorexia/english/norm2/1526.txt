weekly weigh in!
this week has been an eye opener and a fantastic week on plan!
i'm currently sat on the sofa, in my onesie watching family guy on itv2 whilst writing this blog to say how proud i am with myself!
before going on my holiday, i was disappointed with my 1.5lb loss as i had gone under my target range. i had followed the plan and my consultant told to increase my healthy extra b to support and maintain my weight. (unfortunately this didn't work!)
many people have said that i should enjoy myself more and have a takeaway or a big slice of cake! in reality i couldn't, because mentally i was worried about having a gallstone attack if i had a little treat. i haven't had an attack for over a month and i'm due for surgery soon to have my gallbladder removed. i thought why not have a treat on holiday and worry later if i had an attack.
coming home i was straight back onto plan and enjoyed plenty of speed and free food.
after my weekly weigh in this week i gained 2.5lb which put me back into my target. now people were a little confused when i was smiling for putting on but once i told them my situation they sympathised and asked how my week had been.
since coming back off holiday, i have stuck to plan and decreased my healthy extra b back to one to help lose my holiday weight. it was successful!
i am now facing the difficult choice of increasing my healthy extra b back up to two as i'm back at target and want to maintain my weight. (are you at target, if so what do you do?)
i hope you've all had a great week this week and are focusing on the week ahead. i know i am!
