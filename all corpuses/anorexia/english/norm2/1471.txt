l-c-s workout
l-c-s workout (legs, core, shoulders)
 3 - 5 rounds of 5 different exercises done in form of hiit training.
 30 secs max effort and 10 secs rest in between each exercise
 set your timer to :
15x10/30 (for 3 rounds)
 or
 25x10/30 (for 5 rounds)
 each round consists of:
 1) raised monkey press ups
 2) long arm crunch with added weight
 ( i am using 5 kg plate in this workout. if you are a complete beginner, you can skip the plate and just try to touch your ankles instead)
3) kick ups
4)swiss ball knee pikes
5) bosu mountain climbers
 again , remember that the correct form is more important that speed.
keep your core tights at all times .
 start where you are, believe you can do it and just do what you can.
 it's not about perfection ,it's about progression step by step ...you got this 💪
 disclaimer:
 don't attempt to perform any form of hiit training if you suffer from heart conditions or any other serious health conditions . alternatively, consult it with your doctor before hand.
 enjoy your workout and have a woonderful day 😁🌞🌍
