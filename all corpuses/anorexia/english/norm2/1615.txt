breakfast
✦ green tea (0 cal)
✦ small apple (70 cal)
✦ honey nut cheerios w almond milk (1 cup cereal + ½ cup almond milk= 120 cal)
✦ oatmeal, ¼ cup (75 cal) *depends on type of oats, how much you eat, and whether you add things to it. always check nutrition labels
✦ vegan pancakes- recipe link (100 cal per pancake)

breakfast is easy to skip, which is why there’s only a few ideas listed.
