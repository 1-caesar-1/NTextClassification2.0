monday, the beginning of a fresh week and the start of the challenge! your all probably wondering what the challenge actually is, so i will get to the point. myself and fellow pro-ana chat members are competing to be the first one to lose 5lbs (approx. 2kg) whilst also following the 10 day challenge —>
i’m also going to pay for a weeks gym access… maybe more if i can afford it, but i’ll cross that bridge later. anyway, feel free to participate in the challenge. i will be posting my points from the 10 day challenge everyday so if you want you can also post yours bellow as a comment, i would love to see that <3.
stay strong
