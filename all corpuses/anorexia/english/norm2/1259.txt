my mission

stressed but blessed 
under a mountain of work 
trying to dig myself out 
trying to find the end 
somehow forgetting 
that this is my mission 
this is my purpose 
every little project 
building into a greater plan 
sometimes it doesn't 
feel like that 
but i have to remember 
that i don't look at things 
the way god does 
and every little project 
every letter i write
is building on something 
bigger then i can see

sorry this is so late, the internet here has been terrible.
