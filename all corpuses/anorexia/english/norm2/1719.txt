need to get some ideas for a diet, that actually works unlike the soup diet i just did, been so good yet nothing happened i'm still the same fat weight as i was two weeks ago! 
starting to think i should just eat fruit and veg an have a salad every night for dinner an a proper meal at lunch time like a sandwich or something!!! blahhhh
