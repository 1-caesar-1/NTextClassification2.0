sorry seems to be the main word in my vocabulary...
i'm back.
i previously sort of recovered by myself unintentionally and i waited for ana to take me back.
i've relapsed and now back with my lovely companion.
i've missed her and you guys.
there's so much to catch up on!
i hope you guys don't mind having me back.
it's going to take me some time to get back into the swing of things on here, i hope i don't dissapoint.
today's intake:

i know this may sound bitter and twisted but i'm so glad that i'm back!!!!
lots and lots and lots and lots of undying love,
anafly
