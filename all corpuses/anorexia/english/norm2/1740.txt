sympathy for the devil
i have finally cracked it! i'm lying in bed clutching at my stomach and have the biggest smile on my face because i'm back to where i should be. i can feel my belly tingling like little bells are rocking against the insides and ringing out the sound of success, of beauty and control and everything else. and i have no desire to eat at all. 
i have been trying something different this time. before, i could go straight from normal to 500 calories a day without any slow descent. my recent binging (that has been going on since 1 january!) is going to require a bit more of a downgrading, particularly seeing as i didn't put on any weight from eating takeaways and chocolate like it was going out of fashion due to a lot of exercise and sea kelp. i have been so busy at work that i don't really have enough time to eat much anymore. i have a slice of toast in the morning, copious amounts of tea and coffee throughout the day, a salad or soup for lunch, followed by perhaps some crisps, and then whatever my parents make for dinner. i am still mostly eat dinner at the moment. i skip it only once or twice a week: slow descents. i take any excuse at work to walk to other departments and rooms, fidgeting, fidgeting, fidgeting constantly. i haven't weighed myself for the past couple of days. i got my period on friday which would explain why i was 119lbs, but that's also quite a promising sign. i will be 114lbs by the end of the week. two people called me tiny on saturday night. what a lovely word! a little misplaced right now but it will sound better next to my name soon enough. 
i have a date tomorrow night. another excuse to skip dinner!
