"Once A Week"
... this is what I've told myself about my weight. That I'm going to 'weigh-in' - once a week, on a Saturday morning. Now, what this doesn't mean is that I'm only stepping on the scale 'once a week'. What this does mean is that I will only record weight as progress once a week on a Saturday morning. Along with my waist and hip measurements. I will of course weigh in every day, because fucked if I can stop myself. It's like that ritual... that thing we do (to quote eat, pray, love) to know how much self-loathing to take into the shower. 
I am trying to let myself eat more, but it doesn't always happen. The good news is that it has been around 1200 cals, which is okay. According to the numbers, I should lose at least 1lb a week. I will get there. 
It's been a few of good days. It has been a weekend of good days. I had 1200 on Friday through till yesterday. According to my app, that means I will weigh about 64 in five weeks. I don't believe that. 
Nonetheless, I've decided that my goal weight is going to be between 64 and 65kgs for now. This is based on how I currently look at this weight. (Which was 68.8kg on Saturday morning; 76cm for waist, 91cm for hips.)
I want to re-evaluate then. My goal is roughly a 70cm waist. That's all I really want, so whether that happens at my goal weight remains to be seen. My stomach is looking a lot better now that it's toned, so this is a whole new ballgame for me. 
Once a week, the lie we tell ourselves.
