Skinny Love
I'm so sorry to brag gorgeous girls but today has been another good day for my eating, I'm thanking a relaxing weekend at home.
Breakfast: an avocado roll,
= 149 calories
Lunch: 3 raw cauliflower flowerets (isn't floweret an awesome word? I just learnt today that that is what the little cauliflower pieces are called) and a mug of rose and french vanilla tea,
= 10 calories
I haven't had dinner yet but am planning on having 1 cup of cauliflower soup which will equal to 93 calories.
This will bring todays calorie intake to 252. Woohoooo :P
I'm not under 49 kilos yet though... I think I'm going to have to keep on going for a little while for that to happen.
Now girlies, I need your help. I've realised that a lot of my meals have carbohydrates as I loooove bread *licks lips* and I don't mind the odd pasta. Any suggestions on vegetarian meals that don't have a lot of carbohydrates?
Good luck with the week, think skinny
Love you all,
Anafly
