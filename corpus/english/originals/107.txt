MAJOR RANT feeling angry & frustrated
t's been a while since my last post been in a bad place but getting through it. Need to have a rant, sick & tired of hearing about BLM is my life worth less than those people who are ranting & raving, pulling statues down of my history, why should we hide our past we hide it we are surely going to forget about it & knowing mankind we will surely repeat our past mistakes in one form or another.
another rant tired of seeing adverts asking for donations anything between £2 to £30 it's time we said enough is enough they say charity begins at home so before we give our hard earned cash to these charities lets get people of the streets especially our VETERANS WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR MILITARY CAREER MAY HAVE PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE, Their sacrifice is allowing people to destroy our history THIS IS WRONG. I can go on but need to stop & calm down  sorry for the rant.
