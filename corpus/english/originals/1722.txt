I'm Back...
Hey guys,
Thank you for all your kind words!
Thought I might put a little something as i'm feeling a bit more optimistic!
Yesterday I lost 2lbs, because I had half a roast chicken sandwich and a handful of grapes, and did a 4 mile run- soooo proud of myself!
So today me and the bf are having a summer salad out in the garden cause it is just such dreamy weather, so hopefully that i'll help keep the lbs off!
I now know how much support I have on here, and hopefully I can regain my blogging routine.
Strawberry, I eat oranges instead cause I despise grapefruit! Faaaaar to sour for my liking! And tuna is a god in disguise! ;) and yeah I'm going to try and have a lot more steamed broccoli and cauliflower if I get hunger pangs. But recently I'm just not feeling hungry! Today I had a petit filous and the other half of the sandwich from yesterday, so I'm doing well. I just keep thinking, don't! because you will hate yourself tomorrow.
Thank you so much for everything :)
Here's some summer thinpso for you all to enjoy :)
