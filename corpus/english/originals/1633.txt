What I Ate Yesterday
Breakfast: Mio Energy (Mio Energy Water Enhancer + Water)
Lunch: One cube of Tofu, fifteen soy beans, some celery
Dinner: Pancakes (1 cup of oats, 1 banana, 3 tbs water), Chinese Food (A small amount and only one plate full. I have small plates at my house, so that’s not as much as it sounds like. And my dad practically forced me to eat it. If it had been up tome, I wouldn’t have.)
Stay Skinny Sweethearts 🙂 ❤
