My eating disorder has got hold of me and everyday I feel revolting, miserable, and totally confused about my thoughts. I feel that I`m insane- I don`t know which thoughts are my own and which are not.
I feel that nobody can convince me otherwise in my thinking that people don`t like someone as much when they are fatter. I have that notion firmly implanted in my brain, and I feel it`s unerasable. 
I convince myself that it`s too much for me, and then I try to live normally... and it never happens. Because I CAN`T live normally and I am not allowed to.. and my eating disorder tells me that I actaully don`t want to... and so I am trapped forever. It has me, in every possible way. And it doesn`t want me to let it go, and it convinces me that I don`t want to let it go. How do you help that? Won`t somebody please help us..
