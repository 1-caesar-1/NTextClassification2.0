Popping my cherry
First time poster. Long time sufferer of PTSD, depression and anxiety. I did the Marine corps thing pre and post 9/11 then joined law enforcement for 9 yrs. I have had a front seat and witnessed, experienced and seen some shit I can’t seem to let go. My days, thoughts and emotions are like a pinball machine. All over the place. Some days are better than others most of my days I just want to scream and hurt the bad out of me. It’s been a process of acceptance and withdrawal of what the new reality has become of me. I am always on edge, at the ready, and ways planning my moves. I go the VA talk to the shrinks about shit in my “life” but I feel like no one understands. Sometimes I miss chaos because in chaos I feel in control and with purpose. What I am saying has no purpose but I just wanted to let it out. Fighting the urge to go please demons of the bottle for some mental relief. That’s is all. Carry on.
