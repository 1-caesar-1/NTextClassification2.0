anafood: breakfast ideas
Hey everyone! I’m doing an anafood series, which is basically just food ideas for anas. There might be something over 200, but most everything is under that. Enjoy!
breakfast
✦ Green tea (0 cal)
✦ Small apple (70 cal)
✦ Honey Nut Cheerios w almond milk (1 cup cereal + ½ cup almond milk= 120 cal)
✦ Oatmeal, ¼ cup (75 cal) *depends on type of oats, how much you eat, and whether you add things to it. Always check nutrition labels
✦ Vegan pancakes- recipe link (100 cal per pancake)
✦ Egg cups- recipe link (40 cal per cup)
Breakfast is easy to skip, which is why there’s only a few ideas listed.
Stay strong and starve on my lovelies!
