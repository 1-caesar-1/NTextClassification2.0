Bad day today? Just been informed by my councillor that this would be my last home visit, the out reach team of Combat Stress are being made redundant to be replaced by a re-invented system which was closed down after 6mths, community outreach centre which is to be located at the RBL Leeds. 
The home visits I feel are an essential service for veterans, as they offer a safe & secure environment for veterans to relax & talk about the issues they may have, being at home also helps to build trust between the councillor & veterans, building this trust could take up to 2yrs or more as was my case.
To all veterans out there please write a letter to Rachel Calladine, Acting central region, operations manager, Combats stress Audley Court, Newport Shropshire, TF10 7BP
So once again military veterans are being pushed aside in what I consider to be a cost cutting exercise, by getting rid of our Mental health practitioner who do valuable work in saving lives & help in rebuilding the family group you cannot put a price on this service.
SO COME GUYS PEN YOUR LETTERS AND LETS TELL THESE PEOPLE NO MORE F####ING  MONEY SAVING SCHEMES WE DESERVE BETTER.
