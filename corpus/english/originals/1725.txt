Dreaming...
We all dream of complete, absolute perfection. Becoming those thinspirational pictures we stare at for hours on end. When somebody tells us we look 'weak', 'fragile' and that we 'need to get some meat on our bones'- that's like music to our ears. We dream of becoming gorgeously thin, with tiny perfect arms and legs, with sticking out ribs and collarbones. We dream of having complete self-control, of saying "No thank you" to every food forced upon us, saying "Yes please" to skinny in our minds. This isn't just a quick fix. It's a way of life. For life. And this is what we're meant to be. And we will give anything for our dreams. Starving, purging, control, running untill we're weak and faint with exhaustion. This isn't just our dream, it's our reality. Because it has to happen. It has to.
She keeps me going. Always there in my head. 
Today i lost a further 4lbs! I am so happy. I am now at 168lbs (12 stone)!!!! I am so happy!! I'm under 170lbs so i've only got 16lbs left to loose before my christmas target weight! My boyfriend is over at the moment, and i've convinved him i'm ill, therefore I can only eat a small portion of thin-a-soup in a mug to help my throat (win!!!)
Keep going all you beautiful people, today is a good day!
Think thin
