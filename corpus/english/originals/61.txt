After nearly 8 years working away from home in Shropshire and over 7 1/2 years at The Barn, it is time to move on. Tomorrow will be my last day working for Capgemini. So what next week? Well the car gets its MoT on Monday morning. I hope it doesn't need too much doing. I've had it for nearly 11 years now, and it only needs another 7,000 miles to reach 250,000. But I wont be doing that driving along A14/M6/M54 and back every week any more!
So time to explore new things. Keep track of my ideas and adventures here! And leave comments or email me if you like.
P.S. You may find some earlier-dated posts appearing as I try and catch up!
