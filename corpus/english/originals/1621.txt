Just another rant...
I don't matter. I'm worthless. I can't do anything right. I am a failure. I'm not skinny enough. I don't have 'real' anorexia.I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I want to recover, I really do, but I can't until I reach my GW. Then my anorexia will be real, will be valid, will count for something. Then I will actually have something to recover from. I'm the only person who can't have a serious eating disorder unless I reach a really low weight. My mom doesn't get it, my treatment team doesn't get it, my dad sure as hell doesn't get it, I WILL recover if they let me reach a 13.7 bmi. I would be fine, then when I reach it I will begin the recovery process. If They don't let me reach it I don't know what I'll do. I want to kill my self so bad because I know that I'll never get to a weight that low, but im too much of a pussy to go through with it. Every time I see someone whose been or currently is at a bmi lower than 13 I want to kill myself. How selfish am I? I don't feel bad for them, I feel angry and jeolous. I feel like if I can't even get near that than I am a failure and therefore don't belong on this earth. But I am scared of pain, ugh goddamit evolution. I don't matter, I'm worthless, I'm untalented... I doubt anyone actually read through this whole thing. Why am I even posting this? Maybe I'm seeking validation that I don't deserve. Maybe I want someone to tell me that I really am skinny enough,good enough, enough. How stupid is that, I'm fishing for compliments. Fuck me. Wait, who would want to it's not like I'm attractive. I'll leave now and go wallow in self pity, and stuff myself with food that I'm being forced to eat. Or at least I tell myself I'm forced to eat, when in reality I'm a fatass, I'm too weak to choose the tube over the yummy plate in front of me. Really I'm a selfish bitch who doesn't deserve to be comforted.
