She ridicules your body and it's size,
She spills out all of these ridiculous lies.
Nothing that she's saying,
Matches with your weighing.
You're tiny, so frail and weak,
You can barely even speak.
Collapsing, fainting, crying,
The truth is that you're dying.
You scream and beg for treatments,
But refusal is quite frequent.
Your weight just keeps on dropping,
You show no signs of stopping.
It's not your fault you're ill,
You're cure might be a pill.
Or hard work and support,
A hospital admission, not short.
Three months you were there,
Tube fed, but lots of love and care.
Some beautiful and inspiring nurses,
To help remove those curses.
The ones that trapped you for years,
Unravelling all of your fears.
You're healing, you are healing,
You finally have some feeling.
It's possible to recover,
A new you, you'll discover.
I promise you'll be okay,
Anorexia won't get her way.
