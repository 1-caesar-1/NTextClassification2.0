I Am So Over Starving Myself
... but it's the only way I know how to lose weight quickly. Us ED types know that losing a pound a week is just not enough. 
My weight is gross, my eating habits are uncontrolled. I've been telling myself that I don't want to starve myself and that I can do this the 'normal' way by correcting my diet and exercising. But I just end up eating too much during the day and then I fail at night, because I'm like - well this extra 1000 calories isn't going to make a difference, so give me that jar of peanut butter. 
Today, I'm gonna aim for 800 calories. 
Thus far, I've had a small tortilla (122), a tiny avocado (100), free from cheese (50?) and a nectarine (63) and that's a total of 335 cals. I'm going to have a cup of coffee now with soy milk and then that's it till dinner. For dinner, I think I'll have the same tortilla wrap. 
This has been the most fabulously lazy weekend, I've done nothing. And my flat is kinda clean, so I don't even have to worry too much about sorting that out either. I may do some laundry now. 
A bit later, I've got yoga and I'm doing a double class - an hour and a half of normal and then an hour of restorative, which is almost better than sex. 
I'm meant to be video chatting with Chris later, but I just don't feel mentally like I'm in a place where I want to speak to him. So I might skip that.
