Ana? Mia? Edie?
From here.
This girl seems to have been told that Ana isn't right for her.
This isn't at all scientific, but for me Ana is restriction, Mia is ritual and Edie is a bit of everything.
Edie is what I refer to a non-specified Eating Disorder as. EDNOS is, after all, a mouthful.
Keep those mouths empty!
