Need to get some ideas for a diet, that actually works unlike the soup diet I just did, been so good yet nothing happened I'm still the same fat weight as I was two weeks ago! 
Starting to think I Should just eat fruit and veg an have a salad every night for dinner an a proper meal at lunch time like a sandwich or something!!! Blahhhh
