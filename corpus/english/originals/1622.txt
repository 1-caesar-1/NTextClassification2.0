My thoughts on today and yesterday
Monday (yesterday): I was allowed to take a walk in the garden downstairs. It was nice and warm, but far too short. Better than the boring walks on the unit, I guess. But at least my grandma brought my Guinea pig Lenny. So I held him as a walked. Honestly since they've been increasing my calories and I've gained like 8 lbs I'm depressed all the time. I don't feel like doing anything. I only force myself to go on the walks is for calorie burning purposes even though I know it isn't burning too much extra. 
The dietician outdid herself yesterday, my total calorie intake was 2735 fucking calories! 
Today: so far 1500 calories consumed, less than yesterday at this time, but still a fuckton. I still have dinner and two snacks left. Dammit I wanna cut so bad, but I have no tools... I'm officially the fat one on the unit. There are two other anorexics that I've seen on my walks, they are both so tiny, me, ugh my bmi is In the 16s. FUCK. FUCK. FUCK. My stomach is huge, I can barely see my hipbones and my ribs are a distant dream. I can't do this much longer, I think i will restrict again once I leave the hospital. I hope a volunteer dog comes today, they are the only things that snap me out of my depression, even for a fleeting moment...
