It’s 2018, and the media hates us. Type in pro ana blog, and half the results is shaming us for not eating, for having these blogs. Plus, most of the pro ana blogs left are from, like, 2014. I was tired of going through half-finished, out-of-date blogs, so I made my own.
i support recovery, but am not in it myself.
My name is Caty. I’m 16, and I live in the United States. If you want to become ana buddies, or join a group chat, my kik is catyspacen. I’m 5’5, my starting weight was 125 lbs, my goal weight is 100 lbs, and my ultimate goal weight is 88 lbs. Currently, I am 109 (March 30 2019).
Pro ana is not a religion here- just a lifestyle. I’m not trying to teach you to have an eating disorder, this is merely a refuge. It’s that little voice inside our head that we can’t seem to shake, but at least we don’t have to do it alone.
So welcome, love you lots. Remember, calories are the enemy. You have control, you barely eat, and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. Saying no to food is saying yes to skinny. But also, we are here to be skinny, NOT dead or hospitalized. And no one must EVER find out.
