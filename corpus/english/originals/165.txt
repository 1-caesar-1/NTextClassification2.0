Am I an asshole
So my wife, kids, and I are leaving Friday to go on vacation. We are heading to Texas to see family. My wife bought us concert tickets for Sunday for some of my favorite bands. I’ve been in therapy for months to prepare for this concert. I’ve been doing anything I can to prepare myself for it, I’m kinda excited for it. My sister in law and brother decided to have a party for their kid Saturday oh and they wanted me to bring them weed(we live in Colorado). At this party there are going to be 80 people and they didn’t even give me time to prepare for it, if we don’t go it’s going to cause problems with my brother and his cunt wife. They both know I have ptsd they both know I don’t go to parties I didn’t have time to prepare for. I don’t even go to any of my siblings parties(I’m the oldest of 14) cause they have other 10+ family member families over. I told them if they wanted weed they were going to have to pay me money to bring it down( I knew my brother wouldn’t pay) so I got out of that, but now the expect me to go to this damn party. My brother and I aren’t on the best of terms(his fault) oh and I’m supposed to buy their daughter an expensive ass toy box. I’m not buying them shit cause I have my own 2 kids to buy shit for and I’m not going to their damn party. I’ve had no time to prepare for and they expect me to talk to people and be nice to them. If they had given me more time to prepare for the party I’d consider going, but a few days isn’t enough time. Am I an asshole for saying no and should I tell my mother to expect trouble from them
