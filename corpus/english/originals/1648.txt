Ana Mail Day
So, I ordered some supplements and a new scale last weekend & they arrived last Friday. (I've been meaning to update but life is kinda busy.)
It was good and bad. 
Good because I got some HydroxyCut, cayenne pepper capsules, and green coffee bean pills. It was terrible because my old dial scale was apparently 7 pounds off. 
In the wrong direction. 
So I'm officially a fucking whale but it's okay because that just lights a fire inside me (or maybe it's just that cayenne pepper) to starve on. 
I researched HydroxyCut and found some alarming information but, fuck it, I'm desperate to drop pounds as quickly as possible. I took it with a tall glass of water and made myself a spinach salad. 
-1 cup of baby spinach (12 calories) 
-1/2 cup of peeled cucumber (8 calories)
-1/4 cup of veggie cottage cheese (48 calories) 
Total: 68 calories. 
I love this Hood veggie cottage cheese. I love cheese to begin with but 1/4 cup has less calories than my favorite light dressing and is 200x more filling.

So, here we are, 6 days later & 5.4 pounds lighter! Not too shabby, considering I haven't been restricting below 1,000 calories a day.
