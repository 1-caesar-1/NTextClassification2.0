144
144lbs that is, when I stepped on the scales test morning. BMI 18.4. So the number is not as bad as I thought but I feel big anyway. Story of my adult life! ??
Because the weight number sounds high regardless, I feel like I have to specify BMI to clarify I'm not medically overweight.
There was a question on MPA asking "Who are you in competition with?"
Myself.
Each goal weight needs to be beaten by reaching it, then getting lower.
Ultimately its a race that cannot be won, but I'm running it anyway. That might be where disorder overtakes logic?
