L-C-S Workout
L-C-S Workout (legs, core, shoulders)
 3 - 5 rounds of 5 different exercises done in form of HIIT training.
 30 secs max effort and 10 secs rest in between each exercise
 Set your timer to :
15x10/30 (for 3 rounds)
 Or
 25x10/30 (for 5 rounds)
 Each round consists of:
 1) Raised monkey press ups
 2) Long arm crunch with added weight
 ( I am using 5 kg plate in this workout. If you are a complete beginner, you can skip the plate and just try to touch your ankles instead)
3) Kick ups
4)Swiss ball knee pikes
5) Bosu mountain climbers
 Again , remember that the correct form is more important that speed.
Keep your core tights at all times .
 Start where you are, believe you can do it and just do what you can.
 It's not about perfection ,it's about progression Step by step ...you got this 💪
 Disclaimer:
 Don't attempt to perform any form of HIIT training if you suffer from heart conditions or any other serious health conditions . Alternatively, consult it with your doctor before hand.
 Enjoy your workout and have a woonderful day 😁🌞🌍
