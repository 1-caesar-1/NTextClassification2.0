Stomach Issues
Have you ever laid down on your back and traced your hip bones and ribs? I do it all the time. I just wish that when I stood up I was able to do the same thing. I want those prominent hip bones, that caved in stomach, that tight skin over my ribs, those raised collar bones. It’s not fair. I have them when I lay down, and I want them when I stand up. I’m 108.7, a new low, but I’m not really able to enjoy it because it’s just not low enough. I have decided to stop eating anything I have not prepared myself and since I am not at home for most of the day, this means only dinner. Which will be small and controlled.
