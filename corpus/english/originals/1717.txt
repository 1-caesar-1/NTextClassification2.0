Day 2 veggies!!! Aka fruit lol
I am an idiot for work today I packed a bunch of fruit.... On veggie day lol! Just remembered now and it's abit too late to go back.. Oh well whatever I'll just have fruit at work l and have veg when I get home tonight. I didn't have time this morning to get a bowl of soup so i wont have anything but fruit which is ok, I'll just have it when I get home for dinner I guess. 
So guess what.. My boss bought fish & chips last night for the staff coz we work til 9pm and I had some argh, but u know what I'm not gonna count it as a cheat, as long as I can get right back up again, which I did, ill b ok, & that doesn't mean I'll do it all the time either.
Beau is so over it already lol that's fine by me, it's not like I expected him to last he had take out last night and stuffed his face with a few chocolates at work, oh well! As long as we don't have it in the house I guess I'll get over it. 
TBH last night after I had the fish & chips my boss got I tried to purge, didn't really work!! I stopped and thought wtf am I doing!!?? I can't start that again... Right??? 
It's so damn cold! I just wanna b home in bed, I really can't wait until tomorrow is over so my wknd can begin:-) 
I got really annoyed with B last night coz I was kinda looking forward to spending the wknd with him and I told him that all week until last night he decides to make plans for ppl to come round,& not any ppl a person in particular that I'm not really a fan of. His so into drugs it's not funny, I mean he can b a really nice guy and all without that but noooo... & he just influenced beau to do it too, I don't wanna sound like a bitch but beau doesn't really do any of that anymore but whenever ..Friend... Is around beau gets into it and it just frustrates me.
Sorry bout the rant. Off to work I go!
