Hey everyone, you can call me Charlotte. I've gained a ridiculous amount of weight recently and I'm trying to lose it all again, so I would really appreciate any support/tips/people to talk to! I'm 5'8" and my lowest weight was 104 pounds, but my weight is currently fluctuating between 118 and 122 pounds, and I feel huge. My current goal is to get back down to 104 pounds. I might want to lose more weight after that, but I'm not sure what my ultimate goal weight is yet. I've just started fasting, so hopefully that helps me reach my goal. Good luck everybody! I'd love somebody to talk to.
