Motivation???... Someone.... Somewhere????
Ok nothing is working, im in desperate need of motivation... So bad it's not even funny! My life sucks right now, B got the sack last week so we're stuck on a single income (mine) my eating sucks, my exercise is lost and I'm not sure I'll find it anytime soon... I feel fat and pathetic! 
Blah! I never post cause I'm so hopeless there isn't anything worth saying, if I do it will just be a rant like this post and I'm sure nobody wants to read that.... 
I need a plan, a diet, a fitness program, a lifestyle change... Something!!!!
