Some sugar, but mostly sense.
I baked last night and this morning. There's a ridiculous amount of things I still need to post, and I don't know where to start! I haven't uploaded last night's pictures. Suffice to say: dark chocolate. And green tea. Mmm.
On another note.
Borders just released their 100 Favourite Books of All Time
I had a really quick look at the top ten.
1. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen
2. To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee
3. Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien
4. My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult
5. Twilight Saga Collection, Stephanie Meyer
6. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
7. The Time Traveller's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger
8. The Book Thief, Mark Zusak
9. Nineteen Eighty Four, George Orwell
10. Magician, Raymond E. Feist
I'm not too happy with this list, to be completely honest. I get that the top three are classics, and I really liked 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. We studied it in English class, and I really enjoyed it. Harry Potter and The Book Thief are both excellent as well.
But Twilight? It's 'favourite books of all time', not 'favourite ridiculous tween fantasy vampire fads'. I'm sorry if I annoy anyone with this rant, but TWILIGHT. COME ON PEOPLE. It's a pathetic love story, with a Mary Jane protagonist that is selfish, whiny and just plain annoying. FIFTH?
Even undead blood-drinkers and lycans can't redeem the book. You want vampires? Go to Anne Rice, or Bram Stoker. Not Stephanie Meyer.
Okay. I'm over it. -breathes-
I'm just disappointed Neil Gaiman (American Gods was 71), Alice in Wonderland (came 32nd), Gregory Maguire, Terry Pratchet (Good Omens was 96th) or any other really good authors didn't make it up there. Stupid Twilight.
