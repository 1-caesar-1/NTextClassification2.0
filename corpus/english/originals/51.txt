RED ALERT: USA - Corona door-to-door testing
Pondering thought - At least our American cousins have guns and stand a chance fighting back against this great evil that has come upon the world.
Time to lock and load folks, shits going to get real bad, real quick.

With the kind of coordinated fanfare you might normally expect to see in a province of communist China, the City of Houston, Texas has announced a new program that will “randomly” select Houston residents who will be surprise visited at their homes by city officials and paramedics seeking to draw blood from every person living at that address as part of some grand pandemic medical experiment “for the greater good.”
Essentially, there will be a knock on your door, and if you open that door, you will be greeted with needle-gripping “authorities” who will demand that you and all your family members fill out highly intrusive forms and submit to a blood draw. Your blood will then be analyzed and added to a government database, tied to all the personal information you surrendered on the form, all under the guise of an “antibody study.”
