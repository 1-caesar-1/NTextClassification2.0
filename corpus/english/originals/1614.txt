10 day diet
June 7, 2018caty
So I found this diet, currently I am on day 6, and it’s been going really well! I have lost 2 lbs so I am down to 107. I also workout a ton which def helped. This one is great because it helps me not to binge. Y’all should try it!! Here’s the layout:
✦ day one: fast
✦ day two: 200 cal
✦ day three: 250 cal
✦ day four: 300 cal
✦ day five: 350 cal
✦ day six: 400 cal
✦ day seven: 450 cal
✦ day eight: 500 cal
✦ day nine: mono
✦ day ten: 500 cal
Mono means you can only eat one food all day. I think I am going to do soup or cereal. No cal limit on it but just one food. It also gives me motivation because I can eat more the next day. If you know you have really bad cravings for a specific food, save that for your mono day. Remember to exercise at least an hour a day. A meal plan really helps. Should I do a meal plan post soon?
Stay strong and starve on my lovelies!
