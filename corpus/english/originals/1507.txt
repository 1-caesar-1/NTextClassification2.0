Real Techniques make up brush haul
Oooo Boots and their 342 deals. I can never say no and being the make up brush obsessed woman that I am I literally jumped at the chance to add a load of my favourite Real Techniques brushes to my kit! I'm rather excited about the NEW retractable bronzer brush. 
What is your favourite Real Techniques brush? 
Detailed reviews of all of these brushes will be coming soon. Any particular one you would like an in depth review of first?
