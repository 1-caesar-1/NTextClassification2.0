Introduction to blog
heyo! so i'm starting this blog because i am sick and tired of failing to lose weight and ending back up at my goal weight and hating myself. this blog will include daily weigh ins, daily food intake and i will also be sharing my struggles and tips that i have!
My current weight is 166.4 which will go up tmrw because i binged but im gonna fast tmrw.
my goal weight is 130 lbs but i would be SOOO HAPPY if i could get under it.
i have been attempting to diet and exercise for 3 weeks and have failed badly so THIS NEEDS to change.
