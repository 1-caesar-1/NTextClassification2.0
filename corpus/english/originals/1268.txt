Go Burda Style!
I was very excited to read that Burda Style have embraced open source sewing. This means that they've removed the copyright from their patterns, sharing intellectual property. We can sew and sell our creations using Burda patterns!! For more details see the Burda Style blog.
Now I just have to resist the crazy urge to resign from my job and sew for a living, LOL ;-)!
