My Mission

Stressed but blessed 
Under a mountain of work 
Trying to dig myself out 
Trying to find the end 
Somehow forgetting 
That this is my mission 
This is my purpose 
Every little project 
Building into a greater plan 
Sometimes it doesn't 
Feel like that 
But I have to remember 
That I don't look at things 
The way God does 
And every little project 
Every letter I write
Is building on something 
Bigger then I can see

Sorry this is so late, the internet here has been terrible.
