Hard Day
Just felt like venting. It feels like my life is falling apart and I cant control anything. I've been pulling away from my wife (and everyone tbh) for a while now because of my depression. The flatness, reclusion, and disassociation from my PTSD is getting worse and I tried working on it (Therapy, meditation, group sessions) but it seems my wife has had enough, she wants out. I'm going to lose my dogs and my friend and I'm just hurt. I cant sleep and I keep reliving everything every time I do. I just feel really sad and defeated today.
