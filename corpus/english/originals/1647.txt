Day#1
I decided im going to starting posting my progress here because it will keep me accountable. Today with all my running around i burned 350calories. I fasted for 22hours and at the end ate a small apple-48cal(i didnt finish it all) later i had some lucky charms and animal crackers(which im trying to get out the carbs)-85cal and popcorn-114cal. In all i had 247 calories today. And am back at fasting. I lost 1lbs (108 to 107). If anyone has tips to how i can do better please tell me! I hate being this weight...
Thank you so much for reading!
