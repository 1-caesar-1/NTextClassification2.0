anafood: lunch/ dinner ideas!
Day 2 of the anafood series! I combined lunch and dinner since they’re easily interchangeable. Keeping them separated so they aren’t messy to read. Hope you find these useful!!
lunch and dinner:
✦ Soup (chicken noodle= 60cal, tomato= 70 cal)
✦ Avocado toast (150 cal) depends on bread type
✦ Scrambled egg whites (17 cal per egg white)
✦ Grilled chicken and bell pepper stir fry- all you need to do is put ¼ cup chicken and ½ a cup chopped bell peppers in a pan w coconut oil and stir until done. (80 cal)
✦ Vegetable stir fry- same thing, just veggies. Cals depend on what you use, probably no more than 50-60
✦ Squash and kale gratin casserole- recipe link (104 cal per serving)
✦ Personal pepperoni pizza- recipe link (170 cal per pizza!)
✦ Ham and Cheese twists- recipe link (102 cal per twist)
✦ Salad- use vinegar as dressing to keep it low cal
✦ Chicken Lo Mein- recipe link (237 cal per serving)
✦ Chickpea stuffed zuchinni boats- recipe link (120 cal per boat)
Stay strong and starve on my lovelies!!
