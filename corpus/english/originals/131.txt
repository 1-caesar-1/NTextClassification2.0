Rough night
Hello internet strangers. I'm having a bad time. I started telehealth therapy 5 weeks ago. The VA sent me an iPad and I meet with a nice lady once a week. She has me working on worksheets I'm supposed to fill out every day. I was doing one tonight and started thinking about the kid in the street. It was 16 years ago and I can't even write about it without crying. He was just there when the IEDs went off. He got hit by a truck and I could only scream at him to lay down. He was crying and I didn't help him. It is so fucking hard to get through this. I can't ask him for forgiveness, he's in Iraq I guess. Shooting at people in the market doesn't bother me like this. It's that kid I screamed at. Maybe I shot his dad and all he will know about me is that I didn't do anything to help him. I fucking hate myself right now. I don't want to see the lady on the iPad I have pushed it down this long, I'm fine.
