Support buddy
Hi! I'm just reentering this because I gained a lot of weight pretty quickly after "recovery" and I feel like I could do much better with someone to talk to and support eachother, I know none of my friends would understand. I'm 20 years old, 6 ft, and currently weigh 188lbs, my goal is 150, and my lowest was 140. I can download whatsapp or kik I would just like to have a buddy or even a group so we can help and support eachother.
