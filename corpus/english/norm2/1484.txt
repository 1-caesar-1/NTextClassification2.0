ottolenghi - lamb
had surprise guests for dinner last night and just a few hours to get ourselves together. decided to use ottolenghi's recipe for lamb marinaded in honey and herbs. it was sublime - despite not having the time to marinade it overnight. one kilo of meat was sufficient to fill 4 adults to popping; you know the food is good when even the most cautious eater says they'll share seconds with someone else :)
the marinade is surprising in a few respects - firstly that so many ingredients can blitz down to so little; but also that that "little" is plenty to marinade a kilo of lamb in. it is bunches and bunches of mint, coriander, parsley, and then a good few glugs of red wine vinegar and honey. whew! it was delish and will definitely appear on our menu again.
