i grew up around camels. in fact, my mother use to race them. quite a unique hobby to have, yes. i always felt special, because nobody else's mothers raced camels. well not at my school anyway. our house was full of camel "things". ornaments, pictures, rugs, tea towels, table clothes, lamp shades - all sorts of things. it is still a tradition of mine, that every year on my mothers birthday and christmas, i give her a gift something to do with camels. so i naturally have a soft spot for them.
i am very drawn to the desert. i love her harshness and her softness, that she portrays. much like a woman with great strength, yet has a vulnerable side.
i dream of trekking through the desert with these giant beauties. maybe it's my desire to find my own strength again. to push myself to the limits. to feel again. to appreciate. to feel alive again.
tonight my husband and i went to rent a movie, where i came across the trailer of the new movie called "tracks" - a true story of robyn davidson, a young woman who in 1977 undertook a solo trek across the australian outback. my heart sung, as i watched the trailer. once again thinking this is something i want to achieve in my lifetime. hence the inspiration behind my blog today.
