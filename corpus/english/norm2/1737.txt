"once a week"
... this is what i've told myself about my weight. that i'm going to 'weigh-in' - once a week, on a saturday morning. now, what this doesn't mean is that i'm only stepping on the scale 'once a week'. what this does mean is that i will only record weight as progress once a week on a saturday morning. along with my waist and hip measurements. i will of course weigh in every day, because fucked if i can stop myself. it's like that ritual... that thing we do (to quote eat, pray, love) to know how much self-loathing to take into the shower. 
i am trying to let myself eat more, but it doesn't always happen. the good news is that it has been around 1200 cals, which is okay. according to the numbers, i should lose at least 1lb a week. i will get there. 
it's been a few of good days. it has been a weekend of good days. i had 1200 on friday through till yesterday. according to my app, that means i will weigh about 64 in five weeks. i don't believe that. 
nonetheless, i've decided that my goal weight is going to be between 64 and 65kgs for now. this is based on how i currently look at this weight. (which was 68.8kg on saturday morning; 76cm for waist, 91cm for hips.)
i want to re-evaluate then. my goal is roughly a 70cm waist. that's all i really want, so whether that happens at my goal weight remains to be seen. my stomach is looking a lot better now that it's toned, so this is a whole new ballgame for me. 
once a week, the lie we tell ourselves.
