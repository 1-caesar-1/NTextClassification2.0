ana mail day
so, i ordered some supplements and a new scale last weekend & they arrived last friday. (i've been meaning to update but life is kinda busy.)
it was good and bad. 
good because i got some hydroxycut, cayenne pepper capsules, and green coffee bean pills. it was terrible because my old dial scale was apparently 7 pounds off. 
in the wrong direction. 
so i'm officially a fucking whale but it's okay because that just lights a fire inside me (or maybe it's just that cayenne pepper) to starve on. 
i researched hydroxycut and found some alarming information but, fuck it, i'm desperate to drop pounds as quickly as possible. i took it with a tall glass of water and made myself a spinach salad. 
-1 cup of baby spinach (12 calories) 
-1/2 cup of peeled cucumber (8 calories)
-1/4 cup of veggie cottage cheese (48 calories) 
total: 68 calories. 
i love this hood veggie cottage cheese. i love cheese to begin with but 1/4 cup has less calories than my favorite light dressing and is 200x more filling.

so, here we are, 6 days later & 5.4 pounds lighter! not too shabby, considering i haven't been restricting below 1,000 calories a day.
