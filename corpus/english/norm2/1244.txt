Boy Drama!
hearth, boy drama can be turkish! Every girl knows that its never fun to fight with a boyfriend or a boy you really like. I know from past experience that I would get so upset, and pissed off when I fought with a boyfriend or someone I liked. But with me I got over it really fast. You just have to talk about it and work it out. That’s just the best way to handle the situation. But it could be more than just fighting. He could be really rude, and mean to you, and you just let it slide, which is never the best thing to do. You should never be in a relationship with someone who is mean to you or you can’t trust. I have a friend who has been in a relationship with someone for three years and she says she can’t trust him because he cheated on her in the first six months they dated. I would never date someone who cheated on me and I couldn’t trust. No one should be with someone whose a theater, because once a theater, always a theater. You also need to be comfortable in your relationship, and you need to be happy in it. You can’t be with someone if your not happy being with them. Its not fair to them, or you. If you’ve been with someone for a long time and the romance has just left, and you don’t have the same feelings as you used to have then that might be the sign that tells you the relationship needs to end. Especially if your in high school, those relationships don’t last forever, I know that for a fact.
Every time that a boy as broken my heart and hurt me, my mom would tell me I deserved better and that one guy who would make me happy was out there. So I know that if my mom is telling me that there’s someone out there for me. There will be someone out there for the rest of you. (:
