norma has lost 20 pounds by juice fasting

let’s celebrate 20 pounds down since 7/31 with norma.  she looks amazing.

she says, “i currently lost a total of 20lbs so far, my starting weight was 173 on 7/31 when i started the “fat sick and nearly dead” juice fast by joe cross and i have 8lbs left to go to get to my goal weight of 145lbs. i walk for an 1 hour a day or more except weekends and i do some exercises at home such as squats, light weights, jumping jacks and push ups. i have been a vegetarian for about 5 years now and by doing this juice fast i will transition myself to a vegan/ raw food lifestyle.” i believe in the power of raw food too, norma. congrats!
