so, i got on the scale last night and my heart practically leaped out of my chest. 111.6!!! a new low!
using the energy from my absolute elation, i went straight from my shower into my crunches and practically passed out in bed. the next morning, i weighed myself again and boom!!!
109.5
i cannot remember the last time i was this happy! i’m almost able to forget my doctor’s appointment today. almost.
i got a new water enhancer called mio energy and i think it’s what helped me drop those extra pounds. it has no calories, but is sweet so it helps quell sugar cravings. it also passes through you like tea so it gives me a sense of temporary heaviness, not permanent weight like normal water does. it also has vitamins in it, so that’s good 🙂 i am so unbelievably happy, you have no clue. i was honestly worried that i would never be able to drop below 113, and i almost started crying when i saw that beautiful number on the scale. i am one step closer to my ultimate goal weight 🙂 and it’s a damn big step ❤
stay strong and skinny, my lovelies 🙂
