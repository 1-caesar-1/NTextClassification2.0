blah
so i'm not losing anything what the hell? day 3 fruit and veg today but my scales has not shifted! 
bit annoyed really, tonight we have "friends" coming over, i really cbf!! i just wanna go home and relax not go home and put up with idiots! i sound horrible but i just don't feel like having em round especially coz of who it is.
nothing else to say, no weightless, no gain, no nothing! 
on another note i'm starting to hate this app, i can't comment on posts i can't see everyone's profile properly, i can't follow new ppl & i don't have a dash bored!!!
