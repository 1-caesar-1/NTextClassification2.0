hey darlings. and by darlings i mean bella i think you're the only one who reads this.
i'm having a bit of a crisis but i'm back from up north now.
i have a doctors appointment tomorrow and i haven't been taking the new antidepressants he gave me because a massive side effect was weight gain. and i've gone so downhill, and i feel like shit and i wrote a list of all the things i need to say to him, everything i feel and the biggest things that scare me but i don't know if i'm brave enough to give it to him. i'm too shy, i just let my doctor talk and lie and pretend i take my meds when i don't and i want help so bad but i'm so scared.
sorry it a self obsessed rant. i hope you're okay.
