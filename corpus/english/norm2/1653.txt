i went back to my therapist and i actually managed to tell him i've wanted to die, every day for the last few months. he finally seems to be taking me a bit more seriously.
he seemed understanding, i'm going back weekly for a while. he even booked me in for appointments after my 18th birthday which i don't think he's allowed to do since it's a child and adolescent clinic, but he said he's scared to let me disappear at least until after my exams.
for the evening before my appointment and a lot of the day i was in an unexpected good mood, i actually saw some hope and a purpose in life.
then out of nowhere in the evening i lost my mind. i'm trying not to cut anymore since it's summer soon, so i went mental punching every inch of my body but it didn't hurt enough. i settled for trying to break my arm by beating it with various hard objects. i didn't break it, but today i have the most disgusting bruise it hurts to brush up against anything. i really don't know what triggered it. i've never been that crazy before.
i have history coursework due in tomorrow (well technically it was due months ago, my teacher's extended my deadline to literally hours before the exams board will want it sent off). i doubt i'll get it down. all i want to do right now is cry and sleep forever. but i can't let her down again. she's been too nice about it.
i can't turn up empty handed.
i'm such a worthless idiotic bitch.
