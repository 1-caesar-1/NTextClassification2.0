looking for help?  
um..hey everyone. i'm new here and don't know much, i came here in hopes of getting some support on my endeavor to lose. i used to be really skinny when i first came to america, however life here became very stressful and busy that when i entered high school i gained a great amount of weight. i also went into a bit of depression and became extremely introverted and still am. i'm 17 now and entering my second year in college, i tried dieting as was suggested, before than i weighted 132lbs and only lost 4lbs and was extremely disappointed. i despise everything about my body, especially my legs and thighs. i'm now 128lbs and hope to get to 108lbs of possible. i would extremely appreciate any motivation, ideas, and tips that anyone can offer. i also hope to possibly get a pen-pal who can encourage me when things get tough as well as keep me in check. i would also love to do the same, we could encourage and help each other. please let me know if anyone's interested.
if anyone's interested in being pen-pals please msg:
