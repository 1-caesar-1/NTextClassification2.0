aand its gone..
i can't fucking eat anymore.
i'm too fucking fat.
at least.. thats what she tells me...
wow, i'm tracking myself. this is a good sign.
here we go.
me: it'll be okay if i eat some chocolate and some of these fatty cracker things. im way below the normal amount of food anyway, i couldnt have gone above 1000 calories today.
her: what the fuck are you doing??????
me: i'm enjoying this chocolate. it's yum. you didnt let me enjoy chocolate at christmas time.
her: because your fat, and nothings changed! you've already gone over the limit today!!
me: it's okay, everyone has off days.
her: you can't afford to have off days, you fucking idiot, your birthday is in two weeks!
me: i've lost a kilo already!
her: one measly kilo, you're not even at your starting weight in year 9 yet. you're fucking fat. on your 18th everyones going to think your a fat cow compared to your 16th. and you wont want to look at the photos, just like after valedictory. you fucking whale.
me: ...*stumped*.....
her: good. you're not losing this fast enough, you've got to be at least 52 kilos by your birthday weekend. no more eating.
me: you're right, it's the only way. breakfast though, it'll keep my metabolism up.
her: *sigh* you're right i guess. one weetbix. your limit is now 100 calories a day.
me: i can take this. i will be skinny.
her: yes you can! let's do this, let's get you gorgeous.
...
me: what will i do about tonight?
her: just stay up until you get hungry, then you can go to bed. that's the best we can do right now.
me: ok. starting tomorrow, i'll be strong.
... i can't stop listening.
