stomach issues
have you ever laid down on your back and traced your hip bones and ribs? i do it all the time. i just wish that when i stood up i was able to do the same thing. i want those prominent hip bones, that caved in stomach, that tight skin over my ribs, those raised collar bones. it’s not fair. i have them when i lay down, and i want them when i stand up. i’m 108.7, a new low, but i’m not really able to enjoy it because it’s just not low enough. i have decided to stop eating anything i have not prepared myself and since i am not at home for most of the day, this means only dinner. which will be small and controlled.
