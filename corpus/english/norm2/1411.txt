post holiday weigh in....
not as bad as expected. i ended up working late and almost missed my meeting but my leader is lovely and she allowed me to get weighed afterwards. i said to her 'don't tell me out loud just write it down' as i hopped on the scales. i think i get kudos for turning up at all after the day i've had. 

turns out it was only 2.5 pound gain. i will take that. i was expecting at least 6 or 7 pounds.
shrink shrink shrink.
