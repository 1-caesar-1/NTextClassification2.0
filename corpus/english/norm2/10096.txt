it's the circle of life!
as you can see by my most recent blog post, i have discovered a new love. no, it's not for buying shoes, or going to the gym or other such things people seem to have love affairs with. it's for a much more geekier past-time. yes. i watch documentaries.
since i discovered a website where you can watch them for free, i've been addicted. i've watched movies on the human mind and body, on religion, on racism, on heaps of incredibly interesting topics that i find fascinating. i know many people think that documentaries and mind-numbing boredom go hand in hand, but if you watch documentaries on topics that you're interested in then it's absolutely riveting. 
however.
with this discovery, i have learnt something about myself. i have learnt that i can not watch documentaries about...
animals.
there. i said it. 
i just find them far too emotionally traumatising. animal documentaries lull you into a false sense of security. they show you clips of adorable sea-otters holding hands and deer frolicking in the meadow while birds sing and the sun shines. and then, they flash up a few clips of these sea-otters being swallowed whole by a seal, or the deer being slowly chased until they collapse with exhaustion and are descended upon by wolves.
i know what you're thinking. "it's the circle of life, emily. everyone needs to eat." i try to remind myself the wise words of mufasa. the lion eats the antelope but "when we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. and so we are all connnected in the great circle of life. "
at this stage, i'm surprised i even manage to get through the lion king without falling into an emotional heap.
i understand that it's all natural and proper but i can't help but feel terribly sad. i watched a show about baby turtles and how they have to find the ocean once they're hatched, but birds fly by and snatch them off the ground so only a small percentage ever make it to the sea. the rest struggle helplessly in the birds claws.
or take tonights documentary for example, in which whales played a hunting game with a poor seal until it was slumped, exhausted on an ice float. a sneaky whale came up, bit it's tail and slowly dragged it into the water, with the seal looking helplessly towards the camera. maybe it was the fact that the seal reminded me slightly of my dog, but whatever the reason, i find animal documentaries far far too sad.
so from now on i shall watch informative documentaries that steer away from the animal kingdom. to avoid being ignorant, maybe i'll read wildlife articles... that way i don't have to see their puppy dog eyes as they're nommed on by a lion.
