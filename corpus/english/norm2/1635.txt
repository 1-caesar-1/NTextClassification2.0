emotions
sometimes i sit on my bed and trace my collar bones and hip bones and remember the time before my life was overcome with the desire to be thin. i try and remember what it was like to sit down and not have to think about how my thighs squish together. i try to remember what it was like to love the way my body looked without having to be a lower number on the scale each morning. i try to remember what it was like to look down and not worry about if i’ll be able to balance a ruler on my hip bones today or not. i try and remember what it was like not to get up at 5 every morning and run until i can’t breath. i try to remember what it was like when i didn’t do 300 crunches a day in a desperate attempt to get rid of the food i had eaten that day.
and i can’t do it.
sometimes i think i can, but all i can remember about the past was how i used to be 125 pounds and i have only been able to drop to 108.
it’s all i can think about. i am constantly checking and rechecking to make sure i can still fit my hands around my calfs, my thighs, my wrists, my neck, to make sure i can still feel my collar bones, my hip bones, my spine, my ribs.
it’s all i have now.
and i don’t remember how to be happy without being thinner.
