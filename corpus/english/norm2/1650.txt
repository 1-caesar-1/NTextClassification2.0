back, again..
wow, it's been months since i last posted on here.
i know i keep flitting back and forward on here, but i think i might be back to stay this time.
i really helped me last time, i didn't feel like it was working at the time, but looking back over the photos i took of myself this time last year, i would do anything to be that weight again. i wish i'd appreciated it back then. i wish i'd gone out in skimpy outfits and been proud of how tiny i was, instead of just hating myself and feeling fat.
cos now i am fat. fat fat. i've gained so much weight in the past year, it's disgusting.
no wonder my boyfriend left me. he was the reason i 'recovered', he was the reason i started eating more and gained weight. and ultimately he left me because i gained too much. he fell in love with me and my lowest weight, when eating in front of him made me cry, and i was too weak to function properly. clearly that's what guys like, who wants a fat healthy girl right?
so yeah, here i am. i've popped online every now and then to check up on your blogs, but not recently. i need to get updated and see who still uses this site, see who's still here.
i won't post my weight it's too embarrassing. maybe in a few months when i'm more acceptable.
i'm meeting my ex next thursday for a drink. i'm being optimistic and hoping i can lose something by then. obviously i'm not gonna lose stones, but even half a stone would make some difference, i hope?
i'll update again tomorrow hopefully. i need to get some control over my life back. i feel uncontrollable, literally unstoppable. i don't even know what's happened to me. i'm a complete trainwreck. and maybe losing weight will make me happier, more confident. help me find someone to love me again. i'm so bloody lonely.
