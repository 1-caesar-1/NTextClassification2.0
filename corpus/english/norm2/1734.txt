do you remember me?
hello lovelies.
i'm back after another cheeky fling with recovery. i thought everything was fine and i was getting better, but then i weighed myself after 2 months of 'recovery' and saw a number i've never seen before and never want to see again: 175lbs.
175 fucking pounds of fucking fat.
i literally felt sick when i saw what a mess i'd become, so i decided to spend the whole night flirting with my old friend razor blade. it felt so good to punish myself for my gluttony, but i realised i can't carry on dealing with failures like this. i need to deal with them by doing something about them.
so here i am again, asking for your forgiveness, apologising for my disappearance, hoping you'll welcome me back into this circle. i've missed you all so much - i'm back now for good, i promise.
i've decided to call this not a new start, but a new ending. i've had too many new starts and they've all ended in failure. this is my new ending, the beautiful ending i'm creating for myself. a beautiful, thin ending.
now i'm fully settled back into uni life after my placement (placement = place of evil wherein i gained 10lbs) i figure, what better way to step towards my new, beautiful ending than with the abc diet.
