anafood: lunch/ dinner ideas!
day 2 of the anafood series! i combined lunch and dinner since they’re easily interchangeable. keeping them separated so they aren’t messy to read. hope you find these useful!!
lunch and dinner:
✦ soup (chicken noodle= 60cal, tomato= 70 cal)
✦ avocado toast (150 cal) depends on bread type
✦ scrambled egg whites (17 cal per egg white)
✦ grilled chicken and bell pepper stir fry- all you need to do is put ¼ cup chicken and ½ a cup chopped bell peppers in a pan w coconut oil and stir until done. (80 cal)
✦ vegetable stir fry- same thing, just veggies. cals depend on what you use, probably no more than 50-60
✦ squash and kale gratin casserole- recipe link (104 cal per serving)
✦ personal pepperoni pizza- recipe link (170 cal per pizza!)
✦ ham and cheese twists- recipe link (102 cal per twist)
✦ salad- use vinegar as dressing to keep it low cal
