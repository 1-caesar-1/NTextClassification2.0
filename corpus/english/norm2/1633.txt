what i ate yesterday
breakfast: mio energy (mio energy water enhancer + water)
lunch: one cube of tofu, fifteen soy beans, some celery
dinner: pancakes (1 cup of oats, 1 banana, 3 tbs water), chinese food (a small amount and only one plate full. i have small plates at my house, so that’s not as much as it sounds like. and my dad practically forced me to eat it. if it had been up tome, i wouldn’t have.)
stay skinny sweethearts 🙂 ❤
