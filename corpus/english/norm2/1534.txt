an ember in the ashes was one of my favourite books of 2015 - it absolutely blew me away with its complex characters, sizzling romance, and world building. i have been eagerly anticipating the sequel ever since, so i was beyond excited when i was kindly sent a copy for review from the publisher. having read it i can say without a doubt that it is a brilliant follow up that does not suffer from middle book syndrome!
i have to admit that i wasn't the biggest fan of helene in an ember in the ashes. she did, however, win me over in a touch against the night. i think that getting her pov helped a lot. it made me understand and sympathise with her more. being emperor marcus's blood shrike meant she had to make some tough decisions and i really felt for her. a new character, harper, a member of the black guard, was introduced and man was i intrigued by him. we learn little titbits about him, but not much so he's still a bit of a mystery. i especially enjoyed his interactions with helene, and i'm not going to lie, i was shipping them.
elias and laia are also tested in a torch against the night. their journey to kauf is not an easy one, and they go through a lot physically and emotionally. the character development is really well done; i like them both even more than i did in the first book if that's possible. although laia is not able to fight in the same way as helene, she still manages to hold her own. she has a quiet strength and determination which i find really admirable. elias is faced with dark times in atatn, but his strength and unwillingness to give up never wavers. elias and laia made quite the duo; i appreciated the fact that they told each other the whole truth, and didn't keep anything back. it can be annoying when two characters, who are in a sticky situation, could have avoided the whole thing had they communicated better.
i was majorly shipping elias and laia in an ember in the ashes, but i did have one problem with the romance in the first book: the love triangles. i really dislike them, so the helene/elias/laia and elias/laia keenan triangle frustrated me to no end. i felt like with helene and elias there was a missed opportunity to create this amazing platonic relationship between a female and male character. as for laia, her feelings for keenan seemed to come out of nowhere; it just didn't make any sense to me. suffice to say that the love triangle had me worried what direction the romance would take in the sequel. having read a torch against the night i am *highlight to read spoiler* happy that the keenan/elias/laia triangle was resolved, and only hope now that the elias/laia/helene triangle won't appear in the third book, because it wasn't really present in this one. there were a few swoony elias/laia moments in atatn that i absolutely loved. the tension and chemistry between the two was just perfect.
a torch against the night offers more everything: violence, action, plot twists, and deaths. oh my gosh, the deaths! *cries* the ending left me feeling all the feels and begging for book three. the wait is definitely going to be excruciating!
