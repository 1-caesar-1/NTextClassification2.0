intro...
i've never been good at first impressions... there is so much to consider with them. we were told at a training day, "you only have 30 seconds to approach someone new. and 4 minutes after that to wow them with your personality"
4 minutes to change their judgement of you. everything about you. the way you look, dress, sound smile, stand, smell. they will know if you're friendly. or if you're a bitch. if you're outgoing, or shy. if you're nice, funny, smart, a failure..
skinny........ or fat........
we all do it, heck i do it with every single person i pass by on the streets. guessing if they're just naturally skinny, or going through the exact same thing that i wish i could be. yes, i know that sounds bad of me but heck, i said i wasn’t good at first impressions..
but here? it's safe. nobody judges. because in all honesty, isn’t everybody who's reading this, thinking the same thing? we're all trying to achieve the same thing. trying to be the same thing. all wishing and wanting and desiring perfection.
complete.
utter.
perfection.
but, i'm ashamed. i'm no where near the perfection i desire so badly. not even close.
i'm huge.
in the past two years i’ve ballooned from 140 - 180 lbs.
i've spent several days now purging and bingeing, and starving and running and binging and purging and running and fainting. now i need to let this all out and a diary helped me through my worst days when i was younger. at least on here, i have someone who can relate to me. so here’s a few things you should know about me…
- my hair has been just about every single shade under the sun.
- currently it’s dark brown.
- i hate it.
- my boyfriend loves my curves. i don’t know why he cant see how fat i am.
- i used to cut. and it’s not something i’m proud of. it’s been 4 years and i still feel the urge. but i won't bring myself to it.
- on here, i’m an open book. in real life, nobody knows what i am going through and the full details of my past.
- i have to wear makeup. absolutely have to.
- i over think way too much.
- i love to write. and i love to draw. some day i will be a famous writer.
- i don’t care if it’s gay. i dream of waking up and finding out that i’m a mermaid..
- i don’t listen to the music that people ‘assume’ i will like. i like that.
i’ve always felt the need to be thin. i used to be very large in my younger years, and when i hit 13 my weight plummeted down to 120 lbs… i’ve never been able to reach that again. i hate myself for the incapacity to have so much self control over my weight. i need to get control back. i need to be perfect. i will have my perfect body and i will sustain it and i will fight to get there.
