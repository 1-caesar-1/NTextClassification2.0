back on track
so my life took a bit of an unexpected turn recently and i was not sure if or when i would be able to update this blog, but things have now settled down and with things back on track it is time to come back to the blog. i have also been toying with the idea of sharing some of my other interests here, which after careful consideration i think i will. i look forward to some normality.
