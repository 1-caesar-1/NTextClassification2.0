looking for a supportive ana group <3
hiya everyone! ive attempted ana in the past but had very little willpower and simply couldnt motivate myself to do it, as a result i currently weigh 62kg (136lb) at 174cm tall (5"8) which makes my bmi 20. im 18 years old and looking for strong willed and friendly people that can help support me in my journey and in return i can help support them. im specifically looking for group diets and fasting, group workouts, and group weight checks with active members. if this sounds like you pretty please message me! lots of love <3
