reviving this blog and women of colour network
last year following nowsa 2013, a few women of colour created a new facebook group to facilitate an ongoing autonomous network of women of colour in australia for support and discussion. 
the group has been very active and now involves more than 200 members, so we thought it was high time to revive this blog, which has been dormant since september 2010. 
from the description of the new group: the term ‘woman of colour’ isn’t defined consistently, nor coherently across historical and cultural contexts. it is a mode of self identification and it is not ok to police other people’s identities.
we'll be posting more in coming weeks, and we welcome those who have been involved in earlier incarnations of the women of colour network to join the conversation too.
