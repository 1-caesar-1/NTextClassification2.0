running without a purpose
running without a purpose is what i'm pretty much doing right now. i find it odd that i feel that way, but i've been training for a race since december of last year (until the half a few weeks ago), so it feels like my running has no purpose. when i sit and think about that, it almost sounds depressing, but i actually look at it as a challenge. i've used races and schedules to keep me focused on my workouts for well over a year now. it's time to use myself to stay focused. i think it's going to be an interesting journey...

i was on business travel for the past week in denver and i managed to get in a few workouts. the first day, i did 20 minutes on the elliptical and i could definitely feel the difference in oxygen level. i did 20-30 minutes of strength as well with the resistance band i brought with me. on wednesday, i jogged for 25 minutes on the treadmill and i was pretty impressed with how easy it felt. either i was used to the elevation already or it just didn't affect me too much. i finished out the week with more strength training. workouts on the road are tough because there isn't much time. i managed to get in cardio twice and a full body of strength throughout the week though.

today was a run around town, which felt great! i did 4 or so miles. it's a beautiful fall day in new england so it was quite nice. will most likely run some more tomorrow and get in some yoga... it's time to get back to what i thought was going to turn into a weekly yoga habit. must do it for real this time!!!

hope everyone is having a wonderfully healthy weekend!
