shameless self-promotion
hello friends!
i feel like i'm awkwardly trying to re-connect with a long lost friend who i neglected for a while... but i'm sure that you have all been very busy and haven't noticed my lack of writing at all! if you have noticed, thanks for being a reliable reader and i'm sorry to disappoint! but for the rest of you, i'm sure a simple explanation will suffice. i have been very busy of late, finishing my musical theatre course, performing in the showcase, and much more! but most importantly, i wanted to talk to you about my musical.
i've mentioned it a few times in this blog, but recently my writing partner and i have decided to take it to a new level and put on a big showing of the show. we have a venue almost booked, we have a rehearsal room booked, auditions scheduled, rewrites being planned and technically minded friends being put into a list to be contacted later. i'm mentioning it to you because i know there may be some of you who perform and love to be a part of amateur shows. here's your chance to be a part of something special, because the opportunity to be involved in a brand new, original piece of australian theatre comes along very rarely. as the show is still growing, this is your chance to make a mark on the show - help it reach that next level. heck, help it become successful! we need you enthusiastic, creative, generous people to give this show life in any way you can, so if you are even slightly interested, check out the event page and maybe even book an audition. and if you have no performing talents/interest whatsoever, maybe you could come see the show and support the young writers of today.
