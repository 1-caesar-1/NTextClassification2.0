stuffs in my life
omfg the dumbass weekend dietician at the hospital made me eat 3300 fucking calories today. fuck. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. i want to die so bad. i know i'm still "technically" underweight (bmi 16.7) but all the weight i've gained is in fat so i'm not skinny anymore. why is it that the more weight i gain the more she makes me eat!!!!
also, random thought, i've never seen a male dietician before. do they even exist? 
i'm 99.99% percent sure i'm gonna relapse when i discharge. i'm not ready to recover, i haven't reached my ugw yet. they didn't let me reach it before i got hospitalized. oh but i missed food so much. a gross part of me is glad they're making me eat because it tastes soooooooooooooooo good. if i don't reach my ugw on my next relapse before they hospitalize me i think i'm gonna kill myself.
fml. 
i'll keep adding entries. not that anybody cares or is even reading this.
