i miss my boney reynauds (sp) syndrome fking legs. 
my legs hurt now anyway and im way fatter so i might as well lose weight. i am always in pain anyway. 
ate so much already today...
half a smoothie (banana,apple,milk,turmeric) approx 150kcals.
bowl of soup w/half a slice of brown bread and no butter thankfully... 300kcals ?
coke zero- 2kcals
50g turnip and 1 bite chicken- 70 kcals
522 kcals
well 522kcals is still restricting and i can just eat a 100 kcalorie snack later but nothing is good enough anyway. im huge at the minute. cant even weigh myself as it is embarrassing. i look so fat. my waist says under 26 inches but that's not even small or that small anyway when i am comparing my waist to under 23inches before... it is better than 30 inches which was hell..... nothing is good enough anyway!! i wish i puked the soup up in one way...hmm...
met my friend today anyway and got some cleaning and mopping done. going to nap and watch tv. still cant be arsed starting back work fully but maybe tomorrow or friday.... i need some time off.... plus the pay is poop.  
maybe will do a quick hula hoop workout later but no dumbells as my body aches so much.
lol if i watch german anorexia films then it is a form of study for the masters i don't even want to do at the minute... it is self centred... i want to be alone to starve... but i have my reasons... people have bullied me and pissed me off so much so it's not narcissism , it is moreso retreat and depression and alienation...
