it's just another obsession
i have had a fitbit for all of two weeks and i am absolutely obsessed. i'm obsessed with logging my food and activities, and making sure that i hit those goals. always. it's just another kind of obsession. 
it's not destructive in any way however, as i am following pretty closely to maintain a 500 cal deficit per day to lose 1kg a week. i have been allowing myself to eat sometimes as much as 1700 calories a day, but then picking that up with more exercise. i must admit, i do feel good - even if it's taking fucking ages to get skinny. when i say ages, i mean fucking ages. i am hovering around high 67's. i need to take an accurate weight tomorrow, cuz i got a bit drunk on friday which fucks with hydration levels etc. i'm hoping i'm not enormously fat. 
anyway, i do have faith in what i am doing... and most importantly, i am fucking looking after myself. 
still vegan.
